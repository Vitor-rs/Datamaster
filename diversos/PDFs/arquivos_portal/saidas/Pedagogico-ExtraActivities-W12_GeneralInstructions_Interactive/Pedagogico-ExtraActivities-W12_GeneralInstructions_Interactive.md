## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Before starting the first lesson of the book, students should watch the Zero Class on Wiz.me . Make sure the video is ready for students to access, and once they finish watching it, check if there are any questions about the content. Students should also take the Diagnosis Pre-test . Explain that, before the last Review Lesson , they will take the Diagnosis Post-test and check their progress in the language. It is important to show students that they should access the Wiz.tab on the Tab and enter their login and password information to start their first class. The audio content with the instructions for all the W12 classes is in English. Make sure students are reproducing the Wiz.tab audio content at a voice volume audible to you. Also, check whether they are focused on the screen or the lesson in their book. If students are not reproducing the audio files or if they are doing so in a low voice, immediately tell them what to do so that you, the teacher, can hear them, as this is essential for you to offer any necessary support, such as provide correction, pronunciation guidance, or answer questions about structure. This is a fundamental process which helps them internalize the content. Your guiding and motivational role is essential at this stage to ensure that students understand the purpose of the activity and then have full development of all language skills.

## IF AND ONLY IF GAME

After the warm-up with the whole class, students should access the Tab to start the Self-learning . At first, the themes of each batch of lessons will be presented to them. After that, students will have Conversation Practice . They will answer some questions with content they already know in English. They should listen and answer the questions aloud and discuss some of the answers with the teacher at the end of the class. After this practice, students will play the If and Only If Game using the offline content, but you can also use its online version. Students will be grouped into teams and use their knowledge of the language as well as their creativity to answer some questions about famous people. Provide support to students when needed and check on their performance in the activity, taking notes of mistakes to be corrected later. In case you have only one W12 student, you may play the game with him/ her during the Teacher Support. After finishing the Spread Page activity, students should answer some questions about the importance of studying English in the Let's understand the reasons why you study English activity. Explain that you would like to know why they study English to help them achieve their goals. Distribute the sheet for Let's understand the reasons why you study English , read the questions with the students, give them a few minutes to do

•

the activity, and collect the answer sheets. At the end of the class, present the Class Prep card , for the preparation of the first Input Lesson in the first batch of lessons of their course, and the Video card , so that they can watch the introductory video about There and Around on Wiz.me . Also, clarify any questions students may have about the lesson routine, how to use the Tab , the Wiz.pen , and Wiz.me .

## INPUT LESSONS

Opening page: Each batch of lessons starts with a Spread Page , which contains the main theme of the lessons, a picture for context, and the list of Learning Objectives to present to students.

The presentation of this section will only happen once, at the beginning of the first class of the batch. Students will return to this page at the end of each Input Lesson to check on their learning.

## SELF-ASSESSMENT

In the second and third Input Lessons of each batch, students go through the Self-Assessment section. They are instructed to give examples and answer some questions in English to review the content of the previous class.

## LESSON PRESENTATION

At the beginning of each Input Lesson , students are instructed to open their books to the first page of the lesson, look at the picture, and answer a couple of questions related to the topic. After that, students are instructed to say how the name of the lesson and the title are connected.

## CONTENT PRESENTATION

Starting with Lesson 301 , students should answer some questions related to the content they studied during the lesson preparation.

## VERBS

In this section, students are expected to have prepared for the class in advance.

The Tab presents the verbs, and the students listen, read, and say the new content aloud. Students are free to read, listen, and speak as many times as they want.

## NEW WORDS

In this section, the vocabulary will be presented through cards with words. When clicking on the images, students will see the word and also listen to the pronunciation. They will be able to click on the picture to read and listen to the content as many times as they want.

## USEFUL PHRASES

In this section, students are presented with sentences and they read this content, paying attention to the expressions in bold. Students will be guided by the audio in this step; however, they can read, listen to, and say the sentences as many times as they find necessary.

## LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS

Finally, students arrive at the Language Functions section, where they read the sentences showing the structure they will focus on in English. They must follow the audio instructions and the content on the Tab screen. Students can read, listen to, and say the sentences as many times as they want.

At the end of this stage of the Input Lesson , students practice the content of the Verbs , New Words , Useful Phrases , and Language Functions sections without the support of the reading text, that is, they must practice the content again using only their listening and speaking skills. When noticing difficulties or pronunciation errors, correct/help students as soon as possible, according to the proper correction technique.

There will always be two fixed interactive activities at the end of the Language Functions section. In the first Input Lesson of each batch, students will have the Match and the Maze tasks; in the second Input Lesson, Lead-in Text and Read and Match ; in the third, the tasks are Image-Phrase and Lead-in Text .

Further in this guide, you will find a list containing the step-by-step instructions that students must follow to accomplish each of the tasks.

## LANGUAGE PRACTICE

Students must reproduce the sentences and questions they hear. For each of the six sentences, they will find two more words or expressions. Students should use them to modify the original sentence. There are also two questions about the lesson content. At this point, they must reproduce the questions and then answer them. They are instructed to write down any questions they may have about this section for clarification with you during the Teacher Support.

## REAL LIFE

Students are directed to the Real Life section in their books. In this activity, they are given the chance to expand their knowledge of the theme by watching a video, listening to an audio extract, or reading a text.

These are the steps students should follow in the Real Life section of the first Input Lesson of each batch:

-  They listen to the questions from the Getting the most out of the theme box, reproduce them, and answer them aloud.
-  Then they go over the questions in Getting the most of the video box, but do not answer them yet.
-  Finally, they watch the video on Wiz.me and answer the questions aloud. They should watch the video again and pause when they are told to do so in order to check their answers.
-  For further practice, students listen to the sentences or questions related to the video and choose the correct answer.

For the Real Life section of the second Input Lesson , students should follow the steps below:

-  They listen to the questions from the Getting the most of the theme box, reproduce them, and answer them aloud.
-  Then they go over the questions in Getting the most of the audio box but do not answer them yet.
-  Finally, they listen to the audio on Wiz.me and answer the questions aloud. They should listen to the audio again and pause when they are told to do so in order to check their answers.
-  For further practice, students read part of the audio script and fill in the blanks with the words given.

And these are the steps students should follow in the Real Life section of the third Input lesson of each batch:

-  They listen to the questions from the Getting the most of the theme box, reproduce them, and answer them aloud.
-  Then they go over the questions in Getting the most of the text box but do not answer them yet.
-  Finally, they read the text in their books and answer the questions aloud.
-  For further practice, students match the words and pictures in a drag-and-drop exercise.

## DISCUSSION

This activity provides students with a moment for a deeper discussion on a topic with you, during the Teacher Support. They start by listening to the audio and reproducing it out loud. Then they answer some questions or give their opinion about three statements using the information they have seen in the Real Life section.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Students are instructed to return to the opening pages of the batch and mark the Learning Objectives

they achieved once they finish the lesson. During Teacher Support, at the end of the class, check the objectives students have achieved and the ones they have not. If necessary, recommend remedial classes or extra practice in the Study Hall .

## HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS

Students should open the Workbook and follow the audio, which will give them the instructions for each activity to be done at home. They should also listen to the instructions on what to do on Wiz.me .

## TEACHER SUPPORT

The Tab informs students that they have completed the lesson. Use the Checking Sentences to practice the most important phrases of the lesson with them. When necessary, check out the Learning Objectives and contextualize the phrases from Language Functions . Also, be prepared for a discussion on the topic presented in the Discussion activity. During your lesson preparation, check what else students should present to you. Finally, if time allows, students can return to Real Life section to watch the video, listen to the audio, or read the text again, or they can engage in some other interaction with the classmates present in the room.

## INPUT LESSON TASKS

In order to make the class more interactive and dynamic, W12 brings a series of tasks that comprise the Input Lessons . These tasks help students to work with the content, reinforce it, and visualize what is being taught. See the list of activities mapped out below:

Match: Students read the sentences on the screen. They should drag each of them to the corresponding picture. Then they listen to the audio.

Maze: Students organize the content on the screen in order to form four sentences. Then they listen to the audio to check their answers.

Lead-in Text: Students listen to a text with missing information. Then they choose the words to fill in the blanks.

Read and Match: Students read and match the phrases to form complete sentences.

Image-Phrase: Students look at the picture that illustrates the text. Then they drag the words from the box to the corresponding blanks to form sentences related to the pictures.

## OUTPUT LESSONS

The Output Lessons are composed of four activities in the book; the first three will vary, but the last one will always be There and Around . In W12 , students will either do the variable activities on the Wiz.tab , with access to answers in real time, or they will get ready for the activity on the Wiz.tab and finish it with you during the Teacher Support. The activities to be completed during the Teacher Support are always the first ones described in each Output Lesson of this guide.

It is important to mention that, at the beginning of every Output Lesson , before starting the lesson itself, students will answer some questions to review the content of the previous class.

Next, you will find information on the list of Output Lesson activities. Class details, such as what is done in each step, or what to do and expect from the student in the Teacher Support , will be found in the lessons of this Guide.

## FACT OR OPINION?

From two quotes extracted from the authentic material of the previous Input Lesson , students decide whether the passages are based on facts or opinions and justify their answers. For further practice, they listen to a conversation or to a monologue and click on the correct options to complete it.

## LINES OF THINKING

Students are instructed to listen to the audio and link the idea that is presented to a line of thinking, theory, piece of information, or experience they have gone through or heard about. They should take notes for further discussion with you during the Teacher Support .

## ARGUE YOUR CASE

This activity aims to help students recognize a speaker's feeling and point of view on a topic and develop contrary arguments. Students listen to the audio and take notes of what the speaker's views are. Then they listen again and use the other two note-taking boxes to take notes as they build counter-arguments to present to you during the Teacher Support.

## CASE STUDY

This activity provides students with a great opportunity to develop their decision-making and problem-solving skills. Students are instructed to read the title of each case in their books and predict what it is about. Then they listen to the speakers introducing their cases and asking for help to solve a problem. Students think about possible solutions to the problem and discuss them with you during the Teacher Support.

## WHAT'S ON THE CHART?

This activity helps students interpret, synthesize, and report information found on a chart. Students have a look at the title, subtitle, and graphic(s) in their books. Then they say what they understand about the topic in discussion, as well as interpret and report the data they see using the Useful Language content. To check their understanding, students read some statements about the data shown in the graphic and choose the correct answer from two answer choices.

## DID YOU OVERHEAR THAT?

Students' goal in this activity is to recognize not only the content but also the tone, attitudes, and mood in casual conversations, formal presentations, or discussions. Students listen to some questions to predict what they will hear and say their ideas aloud. Then they are instructed to listen to the audio, paying attention to the meaning and intonation of the conversation, to answer some questions. For further practice, they read some questions or statements and choose the correct answer from two answer choices.

## CONTROVERSY

In this activity, students are given the opportunity to develop argumentative skills. They start by reading a statement in their books and saying it aloud. The Useful Language content in their books will help them develop arguments to defend a point of view on the topic, even if they personally don't agree with it. You are expected to contradict the students' arguments during the Teacher Support, even if, in fact, you agree with them.

## TIME TO INTERVENE

In this activity, students are given the opportunity to intervene in a discussion on a familiar topic. They start the activity by saying what communication problems they are aware of. After listening to the audio content, they answer some questions about it and do a role-playing activity where they pretend to be in one of the speaker's positions. For further practice, they match parts of sentences to form four whole sentences.

## YOUR CRITICAL NOTES

This activity aims to help students develop their communication and analytical skills by offering their interpretation of the image presented. They are provided with three topics to take notes and talk about critically and analytically, all of them related to the image.

## INTERCULTURAL ENCOUNTER

The aim of this activity is to help students understand and discuss different cultural backgrounds based on four listening passages. Students are instructed to look at the pictures in their books and say aloud what they represent. They read the statement below the pictures, reproduce it aloud, and say how they think it is related to the pictures. After that, students listen to the audio with four extracts - each one related to a picture. After checking if their predictions were accurate, they listen to the extracts again, taking notes to discuss the answer during the Teacher Support. Then they role-play an interview with you or a classmate according to the instruction given. For further practice, on the Wiz.tab , students read four extracts and fill in the blanks according to the content of the audio.

## INTO THE REAL WORLD

The aim of this exercise is to help students improve their listening skills by listening to real-life content and getting information from it. First, they read the questions and identify the main topic of the audio passage. Then they listen to the audio and answer these questions. For further practice, on the Wiz.tab , they match the sentence halves.

## WHAT'S TRENDING TODAY?

This exercise aims at fostering discussions on contemporary issues and current affairs. To start the activity, students are instructed to look at the picture in their books and talk about what they see. Then they read the statement or question in their book and get prepared for the discussion with you during the Teacher Support.

## THERE AND AROUND

This activity is developed along the three Output Lessons from the batch. In W12 , students will work to develop projects based on specific oral presentation genres, such as motivational speeches, news reports, tutorials, among others. They will work on a different oral genre in each batch. In the first Output Lesson of the batch, students are guided to watch the first video to identify basic information about the kind of oral presentation they will work with and the topics they can choose from. They watch it again to take notes according to the instructions given. After that, they discuss the ideas with you or a classmate. In the second Output Lesson , they watch the second video, which contains more detailed information about how to produce that kind of presentation, and

start their production. In the third Output Lesson , they watch the last video and refine and finish their production. They will only present their final work at the Review Lesson .

## LANGUAGE PRACTICE

In this activity, students work on paraphrasing. First, they listen and reproduce the spoken phrases. Right after each sentence, there are words or expressions that should be used as a replacement of one part of the original sentence without changing its meaning. Students must always say the complete sentence. If in doubt, they can take notes to show you at the time of the Teacher Support.

## UNLOCK

In this activity, students listen to instructions for tasks about the content of the lesson. They must pause the audio to provide their answers.

## HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS

At the end of each Output Lesson , students are instructed to complete homework on Wiz.me . They should watch the There and Around video on the Video card and listen to the class's content on the Audio Pack card . Also, they should prepare for the next Input Lesson or Review Lesson by accessing the Class Prep card .

## REVIEW LESSONS

Students are always guided to prepare for the lesson by accessing the Review card at home after the last Output Lesson of each batch. If, for any reason, they haven't been able to do so, they should take advantage of this moment.

## PINPOINT - LANGUAGE IN CONTEXT

Students start the activity by listening to the audio and following the content in the Getting the most out of the language box in their book. Next, they listen to a testimonial on the same topic. To check students' comprehension, on the Wiz.tab , they listen to the audio and choose the correct option from the two answer choices given. Students share their ideas with you during the Teacher Support.

## LANGUAGE PRACTICE

Students listen to questions related to the content of the batch and answer them, justifying their answers aloud.

## SELF-ASSESSMENT (Student's Book)

On the Wiz.tab , students are instructed to complete the Self-assessment in their book. Include, in your preparation, the checking of the Self-assessment answers during the class. Ask if they have any questions and what they think they need to do to improve their performance. If necessary, recommend remedial classes or extra practice in the Study Hall.

## WRITTEN PART

The audio from Wiz.tab directs the students to the Workbook . They should answer the multiple-choice questions on the Written Part page of the respective Review Lesson . Ask them not to consult their material while answering the questions, nor clarify questions with their classmates or with you. Once finished, they should hand the sheet to you. Then they return to the Tab to continue the class.

## THERE AND AROUND

As the last step of the lesson, Wiz.tab indicates to the students that to conclude the batch, they should review the final version of the work they prepared in previous Output Lessons and make the necessary final adjustments for the presentation that will take place during the Teacher Support .

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Wiz.tab will direct students to return to the opening pages of the batch and finish checking whether all the Learning Objectives have been marked. It is important that you remind students where the Learning Objectives of the batch are listed.

## HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS

At the end of the Review Lesson , students open their Workbook and check what they should do for homework. They are also instructed to practice the content on the Let's Check card , listen to the content on the Audio Pack card , check their development on the Self-assessment card , and get ready for the next class by doing the Class Prep card .
