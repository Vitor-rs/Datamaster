## Introduction

## Hello, teacher!

It is an immense pleasure to present to you the Interactive Teacher's Guide. This material was designed to help you teach the best Interactive class, by ensuring you are informed about which steps you and your student should follow. You will get to know the complete Interactive Experience , which includes the fi  ve steps of the class, the detailed Teacher Support procedure, the lessons' structure, the Interactive Tasks explanations, the lessons' steps on the Wiz.tab , the Wiz.me card descriptions, and the Lessons' Instructions.

By reading this guide, your class preparation will become more effective, as you'll understand what Wiz.tab introduces to your students and how they can improve by tracking their own performance. So, let's start this journey.

## What is the Interactive Experience?

This experience was planned to bring language learning to students who prefer a more autonomous study routine and need to study within a specifi  c schedule. The Interactive teacher is a dynamic and attentive professional, able to deal with students from different levels at the same time. The Wiz.tab is the technological tool that must be used by each student in the classroom. The class has fi  ve moments and some of them can happen simultaneously. These moments are:

Warm-up | An oral activity, at the beginning of the class, which promotes interaction among the students no matter their level.

Self-learning | This is the moment, exactly after the Warm-up, in which the students, using the Wiz.tab , will interact with the lessons' content by speaking in an audible voice. It is important to mention that the teacher should monitor students as they practice. If students are not interacting out loud with the tab, encourage them to do so. You can gently interrupt them to ask a question, for example, and to ask them to reproduce the content they hear.

Teacher Support | Each student will have the Teacher Support according to the class agenda. At this moment, the teacher will have the opportunity to check the student's learning. See more information about this step in the next section of this guide.

Peer Work | This is the moment of interaction between students. The teacher should prepare beforehand what pair or trio of students will

## General Instructions

work together and what Output activity from the Student's Book will be done, according to the students' needs. Remember that the interaction respects the lower book level.

Closing | The purpose of this last moment is to give students the awareness of learning through oral activities, such as the ones done for the Warm-up, or through a speech prepared by the student to be presented to the group. It is especially important to promote integration and interaction among students. For further information, it is recommended that you read the MOP, Manual de Operações Pedagógicas, booklets .

## Teacher Support

For the third edition of Kids 4, during the Teacher Support, the teacher will not only have students perform the Drilling Practice sentences, but also engage students in freer conversations, by checking exercises, and clearing up doubts.

For this reason, the Teacher Support in this guide will present:

- the descriptions of the steps the students have on the Wiz.tab ;
- some Audio Scripts for the Interactive Tasks;
- the necessary Answer Keys for the Interactive Tasks;
- the drilling activities that have to be done with the students;
- a challenge in each Output Lesson that must be posed to the student;
- some extra practice in the Should you have extra time section for the students who perform exceedingly well. This is an exclusive section for the Interactive experience, and it must be done only if necessary as a complement to the Teacher Support. All this is found in a highlighted box at the end of each lesson, in this guide.

## Kids 4 3 rd  Edition's Structure

There are four types of lessons in this edition of Kids 4: Welcome Lesson, Input Lessons, Output Lessons, and Review Lessons. The Welcome Lesson gives the students the opportunity to get to know each other and the teacher. The students will receive information about the course and the coursebook, the characters of the Kids series, and some useful classroom language. The Input Lessons focus on the new content presentation and practice through the four language skills. The Output Lessons engage students in mastering the content through a variety of activities. The Review Lessons provide both students and teachers with an opportunity to wrap

up the learning journey and assess the quality of content retention.

## Interactive Tasks

For the Interactive Experience, students are presented with more than the activities they see in their Student's Books. On their Wiz.tab , throughout the lessons, students will fi  nd the Interactive Tasks . They were designed to complement and reinforce students' self-learning, as well as promote a more entertaining and pleasurable class. These activities focus on the content of the lesson studied and provide students with a variety of ways to put it into practice. These are the Interactive Tasks in Kids 4 3 rd  Edition:

Pronunciation Practice | The students reproduce a few words separately in order to reinforce the pronunciation. This section is done immediately after the presentation of the New Words.

Match | The students see four sentences and match each one to the corresponding image. Then they listen to the audio and reproduce it out loud. This section is done after the drilling procedures of New Words, and contains the grammar and vocabulary studied up to this section.

Put in Order | The students click on the audio button, listen to a dialogue, and put the sentences in order. This is the last part of the Dialogue section, and it provides students with further practice.

Content Review | The students listen to sentences to review what they learned in the previous lesson. Then they reproduce these sentences out loud. This section is found in the Output Lessons and works as a warm-up and review from the previous Input Lesson.

## The Lessons' Steps on the Wiz.tab

This guide will describe all the steps, sections, and exercises an individual student does while doing the Self-learning moment. By reading the following explanations, you will learn what an Interactive student will listen to and gain a clear understanding of how they learn. Therefore, you will be able to provide more focused Teacher Support. For Kids 4 3 rd  Edition, the Wiz.tab audio instructions were recorded in L1, so the student is more confi  dent while performing the activities. It is important that the student have his/her Student's Book, Workbook, notebook and the Wiz.me at hand since the audio refers to these during the lessons. Bear in mind that students can and will pause the Wiz.tab during the activities to do written tasks or to prepare themselves for the Teacher Support.

Note | Teacher, be aware that in each and every Interactive class, the student must reproduce the content out loud and interact with the tablet. Always encourage your students to do so. Once again, your motivational role is essential for a successful class to happen.

Note | At the bottom of the right-hand pages in the Student's Book, the students will fi  nd circles to be ticked as they advance in each Student's Book activity. The aim of completing this step is to make sure that your Interactive students do not leave any activity suggested by the material incomplete. During the Teacher Support, make sure to follow up on their progress.

## Welcome Lesson

The Little Wiz gang is introduced to the student through audios and pictures. The audio guides the student through the various activities in the Input Lesson, Output Lesson, and Review Lesson. The student is then introduced to the Wiz.me and Wiz.pen tools. Next, he/she is presented and practices useful language for the course through an interactive task. Finally, the student is invited to introduce themself to the teacher and classmates, play the board game on pages 8 and 9, and use the Talking Stickers for the School Tour in the Student's Book.

You should use this opportunity to explain the Report card to the student and answer any initial questions he/she may have. You should also explain the Wiz. me cards and remind your student to have a look at the Conheça o seu livro section both in the Student's Book and the Workbook.

## Input Lessons

Spread Page | At the beginning of each batch of lessons, the student will see Little Wiz's gang on the screen representing the theme of the current batch of lessons. He/She will also see the Learning Objectives for the batch. Upon starting, the student is asked to say what he/she sees in the images and what he/ she thinks he/she is going to learn in the following lessons. He/She is allowed to answer in L1, but if he/ she knows how to answer in English, he/she should.

Verbs | The audio presents the verbs twice in English. After the presentation, the audio does the Drilling Practice sentences in L1 and the student changes the sentences into English. In the case of Modelling formulas, they are presented according to the Wizard methodology pattern.

Modelling example: Audio script: This is. Audio script: Este é ou esta é. Audio script: Como se diz 'este é' ou 'esta é'? Student in class: This is. Audio script: Very good! Audio script: This is Little Wiz. Audio script: Ouça novamente e fale com atenção. Student in class: This is Little Wiz. Audio script: Ótimo. Student in class: To have. Audio script: Ter. Audio script: Como se diz 'ter'? Student in class: To have. Audio script: Good job!

New Words Presentation | In this section, the new vocabulary is presented through cards with words. The student is instructed to click on the words and say them in English out loud. When the card is touched, a visual representation of the new content will appear. The student can click on the word as many times as he/she wants to; however, the audio reinforces that he/she should follow these steps at least twice. Then the student is guided to listen to the words in L1 and say them in English out loud.

Interactive Task - Pronunciation | The audio reinforces fi   vewords with challenging pronunciation and asks the student to say each one of them out loud.

New Words Practice | The audio presents the Drilling Practice sentences in L1 for the student to say them in English. The new structures are presented following the Modelling technique and the student is guided by the audio.

Match | To reinforce the content, the student does the Match task after the New Words Practice by dragging words or phrases to the corresponding images.

Take Action! | In this section, sentences and expressions are presented to the student. The audio presents the content twice in English and twice in L1, so the student reproduces it four times in English out loud. After the presentation, the student does the Drilling Practice sentences changing the sentences in L1 into English. The Modelling technique is applied to introduce the new content.

Dialogue | The student is guided to pay attention to the dialogue, answering who the characters are and what they are doing. Then he/she listens to the conversation following it on the screen, and is asked to reproduce the lines out loud. After that, the audio will guide the student to be part of the story by reading one of the character's lines. In order to practice it some more, the student does the Put in Order interactive task where he/she listens to the audio and orders the sentences accordingly.

What Else? | This content is presented on the screen with the key structures in bold to call the student's attention. The audio presents the sentences twice in English and twice in L1, so the student reproduces them four times in English. Then the student is instructed to watch the video on Wiz.me and talk about what is happening in the scene. To fi  nish this section, the student has the Drilling Practice moment where he/she listens to sentences in L1 and says them in English out loud.

Assessment | In order to check if the student understood the content of the lesson, the audio asks some questions in L1, and the student has to answer them in English out loud.
