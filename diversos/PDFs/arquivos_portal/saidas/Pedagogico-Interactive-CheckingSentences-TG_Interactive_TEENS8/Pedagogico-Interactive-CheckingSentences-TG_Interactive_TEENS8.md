## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

## INTRODUCTION

Hello, teacher!

It is an great pleasure to present to you the Interactive Teacher's Guide. This material was designed to help you deliver the best interactive class by keeping you aware of both your students' progress and your own. You will get to know the complete Interactive Experience , which includes: the fi  ve steps in each class, the detailed Teacher Support procedure, the lesson structure, the lesson steps for the Wiz.tab , the Wiz.me card descriptions, and the Lesson Instructions. By reading this guide, your class preparation will be much more eff  ective because you will be conscious of what Wiz.tab introduces to your students, and how you can help them master their knowledge by checking their performance.

So, let's get this journey started.

## WHAT IS THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE ?

This experience was planned to bring language learning to students who prefer a more autonomous study routine and need to study on a specifi  c schedule. The Interactive teacher is a dynamic and attentive professional, able to deal with students at diff  erent levels, simultaneously. The Wiz.tab is a technological tool and it must be used by each student in the classroom. The class is organized into fi  ve moments, some of which can happen simultaneously, no matter if it is a Wizard In or a Wizard On group. The moments are:

WARM-UP | An oral activity at the beginning of the class which promotes interaction among the students, no matter their level.

SELF-LEARNING | This is the moment, exactly after the Warm-up , in which the student, using the Wiz.tab , will interact with the lesson content by speaking out loud. It is important to mention that the teacher should listen and follow the students while they practice by themselves. Walk around the classroom or enter the breakout rooms, if it is a Wizard On class, to accompany students. During this step, take notes of students' mistakes so that you can apply the appropriate correction technique at a suitable moment.

TEACHER SUPPORT | Each student will have their Teacher Support session according to the class schedule. At this moment, the teacher will have the opportunity to check the student's learning. See more information about this step in the next section of this guide.

PEER WORK | This is the moment of interaction among students. The teacher should choose beforehand the pair or trio of students who will work together and prepare an Output activity from the Student's Book , according to the students' needs. Remember that the interaction aligns with the lower book level.

CLOSING | The purpose of this last moment is to provide students with the awareness of learning through oral activities, such as those done for the Warm-up , or through a speech prepared by a student to be presented to the group. It is especially important to promote integration and interaction among students. For further information, it is recommended that you read the MOP booklets ( booklets do Manual de Operações Pedagógicas ).

## TEACHER SUPPORT

The Wiz.tab will inform the student that he/she fi  nished the lesson and that he/she is ready to check the content with you. Use the Lesson Instructions to practice the most important sentences from the lesson. Ask if the student has questions and check the Learning Objectives. Also, contextualize the sentences from Language Functions when needed. During your class preparation, make sure you know what else the student must show you, such as answers, sentences, etc., according to each lesson.

As for exercise correction, the student will correct most of the book exercises with the help and instructions of the Wiz.tab itself, which will provide the student with more autonomy and off  er the teacher time to focus on open-ended exercises during the Teacher Support.

The Teacher Support in this guide will present:

- the descriptions of the steps the student goes through on Wiz.tab ;
- audio scripts for the Interactive Tasks;
- the necessary answer keys for the Interactive Tasks;
- the drilling practice sentences that have to be carried out with the student;
- the open-ended activities the teacher should focus on during the Teacher Support;
- some extra practice in the Should you have extra time section for the student who performs exceedingly well. This is an extra section in the Interactive Experience , and it should be done only if necessary, as a complement to fi  nish the Teacher Support. All this is found in a highlighted box at the end of each lesson in this guide. Also, take the opportunity during this step to correct any mistakes students made during the lesson.

## TEENS 8 3 RD EDITION STRUCTURE

There are four types of lessons in this edition of Teens 8 : the Wizard Experience Lesson, Input Lessons, Output Lessons, and Review Lessons. The Wizard Experience Lesson allows the student to have a general idea of what podcasts are and why

they have become so popular. It will also introduce the types of podcasts that the student will work with throughout the book. The Input Lessons focus on the content presentation (vocabulary and structure) and practice through Reading and Speaking. The Output Lessons engage the student in mastering the content through a variety of activities which allows him/her to practice his/her Listening, Reading, Speaking skills, and also vocabulary, pronunciation, and intonation. The Review Lessons allow the student and teacher to close a learning trail as well as boost the student's awareness of content retention quality.

It is important to mention that the Wiz.pen is an optional resource.

## CLASS PREPARATION

Before starting the fi  rst class in the book, the student must watch the Zero Class video on Wiz.me . Make sure the video is prepared for the student to access and check for any questions about the content. At the beginning or at the end of the class, check if the student watched it. If the student did not, ask him/her to do so.

It is important to show the student that he/she should access the Wiz.tab on a tablet and how to enter their login and password information to start their fi  rst class. The audio instructions for Teens 8 classes are in English. Make sure the student is playing the Wiz.tab audio content at a volume that is audible and that they are focused on the screen or the lesson in their book. If the student does not reproduce the audio or does so in a quiet voice, immediately ask him/her to say it out loud so that you, the teacher, can hear him/her, as this is essential so that you can off  er any necessary support regarding pronunciation or structure questions, for example. Furthermore, this is a necessary process for the internalization of content to happen naturally. Your guiding and motivational role is essential here, teacher, to ensure that the student understands the purpose of reproduction and can fully develop all language skills as well as improve structures and pronunciation.

## THE LESSON STEPS ON THE WIZ.TAB

This guide will describe all the steps, sections, and exercises the student goes through while engaging in the self-learning moment. By reading the following explanations, you will get to know what the Interactive student will listen to and understand exactly how he/she learns. You will then be able to provide more focused Teacher Support. It is important that the student has his/her Student's Book , Workbook , notebook, and Wiz.me on hand, since the audio refers to these during the lessons. Bear in mind that the student can and will pause the Wiz.tab during the activities to do written tasks, to access some material on Wiz.me , or to prepare for the Teacher Support session.

## WIZARD EXPERIENCE

After the warm-up with the whole class, the student must access the tablet to start the self-learning moment. Firstly, the student answers questions about what he/she knows about podcasts and then he/she reads the paragraph " Why have podcasts become so popular ?" located in the book. After that, he/she will do an interactive activity containing some information related to the topic. Then on Wiz.me , he/she will watch the video twice to answer some questions out loud. The Wiz.tab will assign a type of podcast and the student has to research an example on the Internet and prepare a presentation using some expressions from the Useful Language box. Following that, the Wiz.tab will present two types of podcasts and the student has to guess which ones they are, only then he/she will present his/her podcast to you or a classmate. To fi  nish the Wizard Experience, the student is instructed to do some work at home: Pre-diagnosis Test , Getting Ready! card, and Video card on Wiz.me .

NOTE | Teens 8 3 rd Edition follows a cyclical structure, allowing students to watch the Wizard Experience video at any point during the course. In case this is his/her fi  rst class, remind him/her to watch the Zero Class .

## INPUT LESSONS

SPREAD PAGE | Each batch of lessons begins with a spread page that contains: a theme, a picture for contextualization, and a list of the Learning Objectives to be presented. This section will only be presented once, at the beginning of the fi  rst lesson in the batch. The student will return to this page at the end of each Input Lesson to check the content learned.

SELF-ASSESSMENT | From Lesson 183 on, the student will go through the Self-assessment section before the lesson begins. The student will be instructed to give examples or answer some questions to revisit the content of the previous classes.

INTERPRETING THE PICTURE | After the Self-assessment, the student will answer to a question to work with the picture of the lesson.

LISTENING | To check if the student prepared for the class, he/she will answer two questions using the content from the corresponding lesson.

VERBS | In this section, the student must bring the content they previously prepared. In class, the tablet will present the verbs so that the student can listen, read, and reproduce them out loud.

## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

NEW WORDS | In this section, the vocabulary will be presented through cards with words and pictures. When the student clicks on the pictures, he/she will have a visual support and will hear that word pronounced. He/She can click on the picture to listen, see, and read the content as many times as he/she wants. After that, he/she will reproduce the most diffi cult words from the lesson out loud, to practice pronunciation.

USEFUL PHRASES | At this point, the student is presented with phrases and will read the content, paying attention to the information in blue. The student will be guided by the audio, but he/she can read, listen, and replay it as many times as needed.

LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS | The student will read the sentences in this section out loud. He/She will follow the audio instructions and follow the content on screen. He/She can read, listen, and replay it as many times as needed. Instruct the student to pay attention to the content in blue.

For the student to practice and learn the content in a more dynamic way, he/she will be instructed to complete two interactive tasks:

Match: The student should drag each sentence to the corresponding picture.

Maze: The student should unscramble the sentences, moving the boxes vertically.

LANGUAGE PRACTICE | The student will listen to and reproduce the spoken sentences. Right after each sentence, the student will be given a word that has to be substituted in the original sentence. The student should always reproduce the full sentence. If the student listens to a question he/she has to reproduce it and then answer it out loud. After fi  nishing this step, the student will listen to the sections titled Verbs , New Words , Useful Phrases , and Language Functions without written support, but he/she can follow in the book. He/She will reproduce the content again via listening and speaking. If you notice any diffi culties or pronunciation mistakes, help or correct the student as soon as you can, using one of the correction techniques of the methodology.

GET REAL | First, the student listens, reproduces, and answers the questions from the Getting the most out of the theme box. Then he/she reads the text and answers what it is about in his/her notebook to show to you during the Teacher Support. As a wrap-up, the student completes an Interactive Task with the words from the Take a Look! box.

DISCUSSION | The student listens, reproduces, and answers the questions out loud.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES | The student will be guided to go back to the spread page for the batch and check which Learning Objectives were met. During the Teacher Support, check if the student marked and understood the lesson's Learning Objectives.

HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS | The student will open the Workbook and follow the audio instructions for each exercise for homework. Then he/she is guided through the activities he/she has to do on Wiz.me . During the Teacher Support, ask if the student has any questions regarding the activities in the Workbook .

## OUTPUT LESSONS

See below a list of all the activities the student will go through. You will fi  nd in the Lesson Instructions the order in which they appear in each lesson, the answers, and what the student should produce specifi  cally.

It is important to mention that at the beginning of each Output Lesson, the student will be guided to answer some questions to remember the previous lesson's content.

As a wrap- up, the student reproduces the isolated words or chunks, following on the screen.

LISTEN, CHOOSE, AND DISCUSS | The student reads the sentence, questions, and options for Number 1 in the Student's Book. Then he/she listens to the audio twice. Once to understand the idea of the audio passage and a second time to choose the correct answer. He/She follows the same procedure for Number 2. The Wiz. tab will then show the correct answers, so the student can confi  rm them. He/She discusses some questions during the Teacher Support.

FOCUS LISTENING | The student listens to the audio three times. Once to have a general idea of what it is about, a second one to answer or take notes, and a third one to check his/her answer. As a wrap-up, the student completes an interactive task in which he/she will have to drag the boxes to the right place. During the Teacher Support, the student discusses some questions with you.

WHAT'S MISSING? | The student predicts what the text is about by looking at the image and title of the text. Then he/she reads the text in the book and completes the gaps using the words from the box. Two of the six words are not going to be used. On the Wiz.tab , the student drags the boxes to the right gaps in order to confi  rme the answers from the book. During the Teacher Support, he/she is asked to form two questions for the teacher, using the words that were left out. Encourage the student to write these questions before the Teacher Support.

REORDER THE PARAGRAPHS | The student predicts what the text is about by looking at the image and title of the text. He/She reads the text in the Student's Book and marks its correct order. The Wiz.tab will provide the answer to the student so that he/she can read the text in the correct order out loud. To fi  nish, the student answers some questions about the text out loud.

LET'S GET AROUND | The student says words or ideas related to the fi  rst, second, or third picture, according to the lesson they are taking. He/She is instructed to watch the video on Wiz.me and answer the quiz before the answer is revealed. The student watches it again but this time taking notes of any information that will help him/her create his/her own podcast. As a wrap-up, he/she answers comprehension questions about the video. The student will record his/ her podcast, individually or with a classmate, on his/ her smartphone in the Review Lesson to present it to you and his/her classmates. In case you notice that the student will need more time to record, you can have him/her record it at home after the third Output Lesson. Some kinds of podcast require more than one host or guest, in this case, the student should play diff  erent roles or record it with someone who speaks

## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

English at home, because what will be evaluated overall is the production of the script itself.

DRILLING PRACTICE | The student listens to and reproduces the sentences out loud. After each sentence, there will be a word that must be substituted in the original sentence. The student should always reproduce the full sentence. During the Teacher Support, you should follow the Lesson Instructions, where you can fi  nd the most important sentences of the lesson.

SELF-ASSESSMENT (Teacher's Guide) | The student listens to questions and prompts and should either answer or give examples out loud.

SELF-ASSESSMENT (Student's Book) | The student will be guided by the Wiz.tab to fi  ll out the Self-assessment in the book. Be sure to include, in your class preparation, a moment to check the answers. It can be during Teacher Support, or if the student has not been able to fi  nish the assessment, check it before you begin the Closing step. If the student is not confi  dent about any of the topics, he/she should write down what they can do to improve his/her development. Take notes and share the information with your coordinator so that, together, you can defi  ne the best solution for the student. If, during the Teacher Support, the student has already fi  lled out the Self-assessment, remember to check and contextualize/model any questions they might have. Use the topic's Lesson Instructions to reinforce the content he/she mentioned as unclear or diffi cult. Remember: If the student still has diffi culties understanding the topics during the Teacher Support, do not extend the time, as they will need much more than just a few minutes to receive the support they need.

LET'S GET AROUND (Review Lesson) | The student will be instructed to watch the three Let's Get Around videos on Wiz.me and review the notes he/she wrote in the previous Output Lessons. The student should record his/her podcast on his/her smartphone and present it to you or a classmate, so that you can fi  nd out which kind of podcast he/she is presenting. In case the student does not have a recording device, he/she can present a live podcast, playing diff  erent roles if that is required for the kind of podcast being presented.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES | The audio will guide the student to go back to the batch spread page and mark the Learning Objectives. Next, the student will be instructed to complete the Let's Check! and How Am I Doing? cards on Wiz.me and return to Wiz.tab .

HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS | At the end of the Review Lesson, the student will be informed of what he/she has to do for Homework in the Workbook and on Wiz.me .

WIZ MOCK | The Wiz.tab will redirect the student to the Wiz Mock page in the Workbook . He/She should answer the multiple-choice questions and hand them in to you. The student has 10 minutes to complete it. Be aware that part of the Written Part was done as part of the Homework for the last Output Lesson.

## INTERACTIVE TEACHER ' S GUIDE

## WIZARD EXPERIENCE

NOTE | Teens 8 3 rd Edition follows a cyclical structure, allowing students to watch the Wizard Experience video at any point during the course.

NOTE | If this is the student's fi  rst class, remind him/her to watch the Zero Class on Wiz.me .

INTRODUCTION | The student is welcomed to the course and introduced to the topic of the Wizard Experience, which is podcasts . If he/she has questions throughout the lesson, he/she should take notes and ask you during the Teacher Support.

BEFORE WATCHING VIDEO - PART 1 | The student is instructed to read the paragraph 'Why have podcasts become so popular?' and to complete an interactive task based on it.

## Interactive Task Maze

The student unscrambles the sentences by dragging the boxes vertically. Audio script: Podcasts are an easy way to get information or for entertainment. / There are podcasts or videocasts on almost any topic. / You can listen to podcasts anywhere while doing basically anything. / Because there are many options and they are easily accessible, podcasts are loved by many people.

BEFORE WATCHING VIDEO - PART 2 | The student is instructed to take a look at the Some Types of Podcasts box and answer out loud: What do you think each type of podcast on the list is like? Then he/she is instructed to open Wiz.me and to watch the video on the Video card in the Wizard Experience Lesson.

AFTER WATCHING THE VIDEO | The student watches the video twice and answers some questions out loud. Audio script: Was there any piece of information that was new to you? / Which part of the video was the most interesting to you? / What is your favorite type of podcast about? Was it mentioned in the video? / What kind of podcast do you think are mostly heard by people your own age? Why?

After that, the student is given fi  ve minutes to research an example of a conversational podcast on the Internet and has 10 minutes to prepare a presentation that should last from 30 seconds to 1 minute. He/She is also guided to take a look at the Useful Language box to help him/her with his/her creation.

After completing their own production, Wiz.tab plays a small portion of two types of podcasts for the student to identify. In addition to guessing the type, the student should explain how they reached their conclusion about each podcast type. The audio then provides an explanation as to why storytelling and interview are the correct answers, guiding the student to practice this same skill with either you or a classmate during the Teacher Support session.

HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS | The student is instructed to watch the video from the Wizard Experience on Wiz.me again, do the Pre-diagnosis Test , and access the Getting Ready! and Video cards to prepare for the next lesson.
