## Introduction

## Hello, teacher!

It is an immense pleasure to present you with the Interactive Teacher's Guide. This material was designed to help you teach the best Interactive class, being aware of what concerns your students' steps and also yours. You will get to know the complete Interactive Experience , which includes: the five steps of the class, the detailed Teacher Support procedure, the lessons' structure, the Interactive Tasks explanations, the lessons' steps on the Wiz.tab , the Wiz.me card descriptions, and the Lessons' Instructions.

By reading this guide, your class preparation will be much more effective because you will be conscious of what Wiz.tab introduces to your students, and how they can master their knowledge by checking their performance.

So, let's start this journey.

## What is the Interactive Experience?

This experience was planned to bring language learning to students who prefer a more autonomous study routine and need to study within a specific schedule. The Interactive teacher is a dynamic and attentive professional, able to deal with students from different levels at the same time. The Wiz.tab is the technology tool that must be used by each student in the classroom. The class has five moments and some of them can happen simultaneously, no matter if it is a Wizard In or a Wizard On group. These moments are:

Warm-up | An oral activity, at the beginning of the class, which promotes interaction among the students no matter their level.

Self-learning | This is the moment, exactly after the Warm-up, in which the students, using the Wiz.tab , will interact with the lessons' content by speaking in an audible voice. It is important to mention that the teacher should listen and follow the students while they practice by themselves. Walk around the classroom or enter the breakout rooms, if it is a Wizard On class, to accompany students.

Teacher Support | Each student will have the Teacher Support according to the class agenda. At this moment, the teacher will have the opportunity to check the student's learning. See more information about this step on the next section of this guide.

## General Instructions

Peer Work | This is the moment of interaction between students. The teacher should prepare beforehand what pair or trio of students will work together and what Output activity from the Student's Book will be done, according to the students' necessities. Remember that the interaction respects the lower book level.

Closing | The purpose of this last moment is to give students the awareness of learning through oral activities, such as the ones done for the Warm-up, or through a speech prepared by the student to be presented to the group. It is especially important to promote integration and interaction among students. For further information, it is recommended that you read the MOP, Manual de Operações Pedagógicas.

## Teacher Support

For the third edition of Kids 2, during the Teacher Support, the teacher will not only have students perform the Drilling Practice sentences, but also engage students in freer conversations, by checking exercises, and clearing up doubts.

For this reason, the Teacher Support in this guide will present:

- the descriptions of the steps the students have on Wiz.tab ;
- some Audio Scripts for the Interactive Tasks;

## Kids 2 3 rd  Edition's Structure

There are four types of lessons in this edition of Kids 2: Welcome Lesson, Input Lessons, Output Lessons, and Review Lessons. The Welcome Lesson gives the students the opportunity to get to know each other and the teacher. The students will receive information about the course and the coursebook, the characters of the Kids series, and some useful classroom language. The Input Lessons focus on the new content presentation and practice through the four language skills. The Output Lessons engage students in mastering the content through a variety of activities. The Review Lessons

bring students and teachers the moment of closing the learning trail and also the awareness of content retention quality.

## Interactive Tasks

For the Interactive Experience, students are presented with more than the activities they see in their Student's Books. On their Wiz.tab , among the lessons' sections, students will find the Interactive

Tasks . They were designed to complement and reinforce the self-learning of the students, as well as promote a more entertaining and pleasurable class. They are activities focused on the content of the lesson studied and provide students with a variety of ways to put it into practice. These are the Interactive Tasks in Kids 2:

Pronunciation Practice | The students reproduce a few words separately in order to reinforce the pronunciation.

Match | The students see four sentences and match each one to the corresponding image. Then they listen to the audio and reproduce it out loud.

Put in Order | The students click on the audio button, listen to a dialogue, and put the sentences in order.

Content Review | The students listen to sentences to review what they learned in the previous lesson. Then they reproduce these sentences out loud.

## The Lessons' Steps on the Wiz.tab

This guide will describe to you all the steps, sections, and exercises the students do while doing the Self-learning moment. By reading the following explanations you will get to know what the Interactive students will listen to and understand exactly how they learn. Therefore, you will be able to provide more focused Teacher Support. For Kids 2, the Wiz.tab audio instructions were recorded in L1, so students are more confident while performing the activities. Students may use the Voice Management system to change the narrator's voice and also change the narration speed, making it slower or faster. It is important that the student has his/her Student's Book, Workbook, notebook and the Wiz.me at hand since the audio refers to these during the lessons. Bear in mind that students can and will pause the Wiz.tab during the activities to do written tasks or to prepare themselves for the Teacher Support.

## Welcome Lesson

The Little Wiz gang is introduced to the student through audios and pictures. The audio presents the various types of activities of the Input Lesson, the Output Lesson, and the Review Lesson. The student is advised about the Wiz.me and the Wiz.pen . Then the student is presented with and practices useful language to be used throughout the course in an interactive task. Finally, the student is invited to introduce him/herself to the teacher and other students, play the board game on pages 8 and 9 and use the Talking Stickers for the School Tour in the Student's Book.
