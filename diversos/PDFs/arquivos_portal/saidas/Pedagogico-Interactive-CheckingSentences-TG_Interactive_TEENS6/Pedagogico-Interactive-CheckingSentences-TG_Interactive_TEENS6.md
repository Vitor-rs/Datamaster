## GENERAL  INSTRUCTIONS

## HELLO, TEACHER!

## INTRODUCTION

Hello, teacher!

It is an immense pleasure to present to you the Interactive Teacher's Guide. This material was designed to help you teach your best Interactive classes and stay aware of what concerns your students' steps and also yours. You will get to know the complete Interactive Experience , which includes: the five steps in each class, the detailed Teacher Support procedure, the lesson structure, the lesson steps for the Wiz.tab , the Wiz.me card descriptions, and the Lesson Instructions. By reading this guide, your class preparation will be much more effective because you will be conscious of what Wiz.tab introduces to your students, and how you can help them master their knowledge by checking their performance.

So, let's get this journey started.

## WHAT IS THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE ?

This experience was planned to bring language learning to students who prefer a more autonomous study routine and need to study on a specific schedule. The Interactive teacher is a dynamic and attentive professional, able to deal with students at different levels, simultaneously. The Wiz.tab is a technological tool and it must be used by each student in the classroom. The class is organized into five moments, some of which can happen simultaneously, no matter if it is a Wizard In or a Wizard On group. The moments are:

WARM-UP | An oral activity, at the beginning of class which promotes interaction among the students no matter their level.

SELF-LEARNING | This is the moment, exactly after the Warm-up , in which the student, using the Wiz.tab , will interact with the lesson content by speaking out loud. It is important to mention that the teacher should listen and follow the students while they practice by themselves. Walk around the classroom or enter the breakout rooms, if it is a Wizard On class, to accompany students.

TEACHER SUPPORT | Each student will have their Teacher Support session according to the class schedule. At this moment, the teacher will have the opportunity to check the student's learning. See more information about this step in the next section of this guide.

PEER WORK | This is the moment of interaction among students. The teacher should choose beforehand the pair or trio of students who will work together and prepare an Output activity from the Student's Book, according to the students' necessities. Remember that the interaction aligns with the lower book level.

CLOSING | The purpose of this last moment is to provide students with the awareness of learning through oral activities, such as those done for the Warm-up , or through a speech prepared by a student to be presented to the group. It is especially important to promote integration and interaction among students.

For further information, it is recommended to read the MOP, Manual de Operações Pedagógicas .

## TEACHER SUPPORT

The Wiz.tab will inform the student that he/she finished the lesson and that he/she is ready to check the content with you. Use the Lesson Instructions to practice the most important sentences from the lesson. Ask if the student has questions, and check the Learning Objectives. Also, contextualize the sentences from Language Functions when needed. During your class preparation, make sure you know what else the student must show you, such as answers, sentences, etc., according to each lesson.

As for exercise correction, the student will correct most of the book exercises with the help and instructions of the Wiz.tab itself, which will provide the student with more autonomy and offer the teacher time to focus on open-ended exercises during Teacher Support.

The Teacher Support in this guide will present:

- the descriptions of the steps the student goes through on Wiz.tab ;
- audio scripts for the Interactive Tasks;
- the necessary answer keys for the Interactive Tasks;
- the drilling activities that have to be carried out with the student;
- the open-ended activities the teacher should focus on during Teacher Support;
- some extra practice in the Should You Have Extra Time section for the student who performs exceedingly well. This is an extra section in the Interactive Experience , and it should be done only if necessary, as a complement to finish the Teacher Support. All this is found in a highlighted box at the end of each lesson in this guide.

## TEENS 6 3 RD EDITION STRUCTURE

There are four types of lessons in this edition of Teens 6 : Wizard Experience Lesson, Input Lessons, Output Lessons, and Review Lessons. The Wizard Experience Lesson allows the students to have a general view of the soft skills they will work with throughout the lessons. The Input Lessons focus on the content presentation and practice through the four language skills. The Output Lessons engage students in mastering the content through a variety of activities. The Review Lessons bring to students and teachers the moment of closing a learning trail and also boost their awareness of content retention quality.

It is important to mention that the Wiz.pen is an optional resource.

## CLASS PREPARATION

Before starting the first class in the book, the student must watch the Zero Class on Wiz.me . Make sure the video is prepared for the student to access, and check for any questions about the content. It is important to show the student that he/she should access the Wiz.tab on the tablet and enter their login and password information to then start their first class. The audio instructions for Teens 6 classes are in English. Make sure the student is playing the Wiz.tab audio content at a volume that is audible to you and that they are focused on the screen or the lesson in their book. If the student does not reproduce the audio or does so in a quiet voice, immediately ask him/her to say it out loud so that you, the teacher, can hear him/her, as this is essential so that you can offer any necessary support regarding pronunciation or structure questions, for example. Furthermore, this is a necessary process for the internalization of content to happen naturally. Your guiding and motivational role is essential here, teacher, to ensure that the student understands the purpose of reproduction and can fully develop all language skills.

## THE LESSON STEPS ON THE WIZ.TAB

This guide will describe all the steps, sections, and exercises the student goes through while engaging in the self-learning moment. By reading the following explanations, you will get to know what the Interactive student will listen to and understand exactly how he/she learns. Therefore, you will be able to provide more focused Teacher Support.

The student may use the Voice Management system to change the narrator's voice and also change the narration speed, making it slower or faster. It is important that the student has his/her Student's Book , Workbook , notebook, and Wiz.me on hand, since the audio refers to these during the lessons. Bear in mind that the student can and will pause the Wiz.tab during the activities to do written tasks or to prepare for the Teacher Support moment.

## WIZARD EXPERIENCE

After the warm-up with the whole class, the student must access the tablet to start the self-learning moment. Firstly, the student must read the text titled " What Are Soft Skills? " located in the book, and then he/she will do an interactive activity containing some facts related to the topic. After that, in the notebook, he/she will have to answer some questions. After watching the video on Wiz.me , he/she must write a role-play about a real situation in which the interpersonal skills presented in the video can be used.

## INPUT LESSONS

SPREAD PAGE | Each batch of lessons begins with a spread page that contains: a theme, a picture for contextualization, and a list of the Learning Objectives to be presented. This section will only be presented once, at the beginning of the first lesson in the batch. The student will return to this page at the end of each Input Lesson to check the content learned.

SELF-ASSESSMENT | From Lesson 123 on, the student will go through the Self-assessment section before the lesson begins. The student will be instructed to give examples and answer some questions to revisit the content of the previous classes.

INTERPRETING THE PICTURE | After the Self-assessment, the student will answer questions to work with the picture of the lesson.

LISTENING | To check if the student prepared for the class, he/she will answer two questions using the content from the corresponding lesson.

VERBS | In this section, the student must bring the content they previously prepared. In class, the tablet will present the verbs so that the student can listen, read, and reproduce them out loud. The student is free to do this procedure as many times as needed.

## GENERAL  INSTRUCTIONS

NEW WORDS | In this section, the vocabulary will be presented through cards with words and pictures. When the student clicks on the word, he/she will see visual support and will hear that word pronounced. He/She can click on the word to listen, see, and read the content as many times as he/she wants. After that, he/she will reproduce the most difficult words from the lesson out loud, to practice pronunciation.

USEFUL PHRASES | At this point, the student is presented with phrases and will read the content, paying attention to the information in bold. The student will be guided by the audio, but he/she can read, listen, and replay it as many times as needed.

LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS | The student will read the sentences in this section out loud. He/She will follow the audio instructions and follow the content on screen. He/She can read, listen, and replay it as many times as needed.

In order for the student to practice and learn the content in a more dynamic way, he/she will be instructed to complete two interactive tasks:

Match: The student should drag each sentence to the corresponding picture.

Maze: The student should unscramble the sentences, moving the boxes vertically.

LANGUAGE PRACTICE | The student will listen to and reproduce the spoken sentences. Right after each sentence, the student will receive a word that has to be substituted in the original sentence. The student should always reproduce the full sentence. After finishing this step, the student will listen to the sections titled Verbs , New Words , Useful Phrases , and Language Functions without written support. He/She will practice the phrases again via listening and speaking. If you notice any difficulties or pronunciation mistakes, help or correct the student as soon as you can, using one of the correction techniques of the methodology.

GET REAL | At first, the student will be directed to the pictures in the section and will say which words or expressions come to mind when he/she sees them. Then, he/she will be guided to write sentences in his/her notebook that refer to the pictures and explore the content. At the end of the class, you will check the sentences the student prepared.

DID YOU KNOW… ? | First, the student will talk about what he/she sees in the picture. Then he/she will be instructed to watch the video on Wiz.me and complete the multiple-choice activity in the app. After that, he/she will answer a question and will have to write sentences using the content he/she learned. It is important that by the end of the class you, the teacher, be sure to check the examples the student wrote to make sure they are correctly produced.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES | The student will be guided to go back to the spread page for the batch and check which Learning Objectives were met. During Teacher Support, check if the student marked and understood the lesson Learning Objectives.

HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS | The student will open the Workbook and follow the audio instructions for each exercise for homework.

## OUTPUT LESSONS

Throughout the three Output Lessons, he/she should create one single dialogue with an enigma to be presented in the Review Lesson. The development of the dialogue must be divided into three parts as follows: In the first Output Lesson, the student has to decide the answer of their enigma and the level of difficulty. In the second Output Lesson, he/she has to use the notes from the previous lesson to start writing the dialogue, which must contain a hint that leads to the enigma. And in the last Output Lesson of the batch, he/she has to use the time to finish and refine his/her production. The student is guided to always refer to the audio script found at the end of his/her Student's Book as a model.

## GENERAL  INSTRUCTIONS

DRILLING PRACTICE | There are two types of Drilling Practice in the Output Lessons. In the first drilling practice, the student should listen to and reproduce the sentences out loud. After each sentence, there will be a word that must be substituted in the original sentence. The student should always reproduce the full sentence. During Teacher Support, you should follow the Lesson Instructions, where you can find the most important sentences of the lesson.

In the second Drilling Practice, the student will be instructed to change the sentences to the affirmative, negative, interrogative, or past tense forms.

UNLOCK | The student will listen to prompts or questions and should either answer or give examples.

HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS | At the end of the Output Lesson, the Wiz.tab will remind the student that the homework can be found on the respective lesson's card on Wiz.me .

## REVIEW LESSONS

PINPOINT | The student will observe the picture and say what he/she sees.

PODCAST | The student will listen to the audio and say which content from the podcast was presented in the batch. He/She will listen to the audio one more time to answer some questions in their notebook. Check those questions during Teacher Support. Then the student will complete an activity on the Wiz.tab by dragging the words into the correct order and reproducing the sentences out loud. To finish, the student should write a paragraph giving his/her opinion about the content he/she heard.

CONVERSATION PRACTICE | In this section, the student will listen to six questions, which he/she will have to reproduce and answer out loud.

SELF-ASSESSMENT (Teacher's Guide) | The student listens to questions and prompts and should either answer or give examples out loud.

SELF-ASSESSMENT (Student's Book) | The student will be guided by the Wiz.tab to fill out the Self-assessment in the book. Be sure to include, in your class preparation, a moment to check the answers. It can be during Teacher Support, or if the student has not been able to finish the assessment, check it before you begin the Closing step. If the student is not confident about any of the topics, he/she should write down what they can do to improve his/her development. Take notes and share the information with your coordinator so that, together, you can define the best solution for the student. If, during Teacher Support, the student has already filled out the Self-assessment, remember to check and contextualize/model any questions they might have. Use the topic's Lesson Instructions to reinforce the content he/she mentioned as unclear or difficult. Remember: if the student still has difficulties understanding the topics during Teacher Support, do not extend the time, as they will need much more than just a few minutes to receive the support they need.

LET'S GET AROUND (Review Lesson) | The student will be instructed to watch the three Let's Get Around videos on Wiz.me and review the dialogue he/she wrote in the previous Output Lessons. The student should join a classmate to present his/her dialogue to the teacher or the whole group so that they can find the answer to the enigma he/she created.
