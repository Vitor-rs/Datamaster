against | counterculture | equality | subculture | identities | liberation | perspectives | norms | rights | struggle

It's hard to encourage individual cultural without promoting divisiveness. In the United States, at least, it's a constant for people who see things from different and end up being part of subcultures or countercultures. A is shared by a small group of people who have specific cultural attributes that set them apart. A can be more than simply different from mainstream culture. It is a pushback on mainstream culture in an attempt to change how a society functions. Let's go to the thought bubble to take a trip back to one of the biggest countercultural periods of the 20 th  century, the 1960s. In the United States, the 1960s were rife with countercultures. It was a time of beatniks and hippies, of protests against the Vietnam

War, and protest for civil rights and women's

.

These movements were often led by young people and were seen as a rebellion against the culture and of older generations. This was the era of free love. But this counterculture was also a pushback politically mainstream culture. Many cornerstones of the politics of the American

left have their origins in the counterculture of the 1960s - anti-war, pro-environmentalism, pro-civil , feminism, and LGBTQ .

From the Stonewall riots to the Vietnam War protests, the 1960s counterculture was where many of these issues first reached the public consciousness .

## Native Americans Revitalize Ancient Tattoo Tradition

For thousands of years, tattooing was an important form of cultural expression for Indigenous people across the Americas, but missionaries abolished the practice at different points in time as part of efforts to assimilate tribes and convert them to Christianity.

Today, a growing number of Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiians are reviving tattooing, using methods their ancestors developed millennia ago. Jody Potts-Joseph was born and raised in the Yukon River village of Eagle, home of the Athabascan-speaking Han Gwich'in people.

She was raised pretty old school on the land and learned their traditional way of life, hunting and fishing for subsistence. Jody was 18 when she learned that historically, Gwich'in men and women got tattooed - men on their joints and wrists, and women on their faces - as a rite of passage.

For years, Potts-Joseph wanted to have her chin marked, but the last Gwich'in tattoo artists had passed away. Her daughter, Quannah Chasinghorse, also wanted a tattoo.

'She was only 12 at the time, and I told her to wait,' Potts-Joseph said. 'I wanted to make sure that she was in an emotional space where she could handle any possible criticism or backlash.'

After two years of praying on it, Potts-Joseph relented. Using a large ink-dipped sewing needle, she gave her daughter what is called Yidiiltoo - lines at her eyes and on her chin. Soon afterward, Potts-Joseph enlisted her then-16-year-old son Izzy to ink her chin.

'For me, it was a reclaiming of my identity and part of my resistance to the shaming of our people after colonization,' she said. 'And I saw my daughter change - she came into her power. She found her voice. Tattooing is powerful medicine.'

I totally agree. Glocalization has brought many more positive consequences than negative ones to our economy.

I agree with you up to a point. We urge more tourists and development to come to the city, but the risk that people here want a distinct culture from the one they already have must be considered.

Rubbish! Progress will make diverse microcultures within Bhutan disappear before their existence can even be recorded. Our people don't want it!

OK! Let's be sensible here because the topic is delicate. It's time to think of progress from another perspective. It must bring benefits to people, but it can't destroy local cultures. Not to mention the necessity to preserve the environment.

Moviegoers have really enjoyed the African part of Black Panther . This is unique because Ethiopia is often mentioned alongside the black power and black movements in the fight against as the only nation not colonized by Western powers.

Like many at the movie's premiere, the South African actor John Kani expressed at seeing an Afrofuturistic society that celebrates traditional and dreams of what the world's second most populous continent can be.

'This time the sun now is shining on Africa,' he said. 'This movie came at the right time. We're struggling to find leaders that are exemplary role models. So when you see the Black Panther as a young boy and he takes off that mask you think, 'Oh my God, he looks like me. He is African and I am African. Now we can look up to some person who is African. He makes me a little taller.'' He was talking about the actor Chadwick Boseman, who passed away some time after the release of the movie, but is still much loved by millions of fans.

At the time of the movie release, some Ethiopian fans quickly changed their Facebook pictures and expressed their adoration. 'Tears stream down my face as I write this,' said one social media user who goes by LadyRock Maranatha.

' Black Panther was an enormous roller coaster of emotions, adventure, and most of all, the affirmation of what I had felt since I left my country for Cambridge and returned. I cried for my people and felt immense pride in Ethiopian and most : AFRICAN. We are truly resilient and beautiful. It was about time we our roots!'

As Ghanaian celebrity blogger Ameyaw Debrah put it on social media: 'What will come to when people think of Africa now?'

## Most popular last names in the United States

## Dora Mekouar

'Johnson' is one of the most common surnames in each U.S. state, but it isn't the number one.

Smith is the most common last name in the United States, followed by Johnson, Miller, Jones, Williams, and Anderson, according to genealogy company Ancestry.com.

What the most common surnames in the United States have in common is that they all have English, Scottish, Irish, or Welsh roots because people from those countries were among the first Europeans to settle in North America.

Last names were not commonly used in England until 1066 when population growth made it necessary. Inspirations for a second name or last name were generally inspired by the father's name, where a person lived, their occupation, or even a nickname.

Today, where you live in the United States can determine which name you hear the most. Northwesterners are more likely to meet an Anderson, while on the East Coast people named Brown are more common.

There's much more variety in the American Southwest. Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona have large Latino populations and a variety of names such as Garcia, Hernandez, Martinez, and Chavez.

## 32 Years After U.S. Disabilities Act, No Plans to Ratify UN Treaty It Inspired

WASHINGTON - On the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the United States remains one of a handful of countries that have not ratified the 2006 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) - an international treaty the U.S. legislation inspired.

The ADA, signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on July 26, 1990, prohibits discrimination based on disability in public accommodation, employment, transportation, and community living, and provides recourse for people with disabilities who faced discrimination.

'If you're disabled, stores can turn you away, and employers can refuse to hire you. If you use a wheelchair, there is no accommodation to take the bus or train to school or to work. Premises are not equipped to welcome you. America simply wasn't built for all Americans,' U.S. president Joe Biden said.

Sara Minkara, who is legally blind, leads the Office of International Disability Rights at the U.S. Department of State, which promotes the rights of persons with disabilities around the world through American diplomacy and development aid. The position was created under the Obama administration, and her office was made permanent by the Biden administration last November.

In various countries, views on people with disabilities often fall between pity and taking inspiration from their suffering, Minkara said, and those extreme narratives contribute to societies leaving people with disabilities behind.

'We need to normalize disability. We need to change how we look at the word disability . We need to change how we look at disabilities and identities, not from a pity lens but from a strength and value-based lens. This way we will be working in the best interest of people with disabilities.'

## Treatment Found Wanting for Growing Mental Health Disorders

GENEVA - The World Health Organization is calling for a radical change in the treatment of mental health disorders. Their perception is that existing care systems are largely ineffective and often abusive.

Nearly a billion people were living with a mental disorder in 2019. That number has grown, with new data showing conditions such as depression and anxiety increasing by more than 26 percent in the first year of the coronavirus pandemic.

The World Health Organization released its largest review of world mental health since the turn of the century. The report finds 14 percent, or one in seven adolescents, is suffering from a mental disorder. It says suicides account for one in 100 deaths, with 58 percent occurring before age 50. This is a key issue the world has to cope with.

The head of the WHO's mental health unit, Mark Van Ommeren, says mental disorders are the leading cause of disability. He says depression and anxiety alone cost the world economy nearly $1 trillion a year in lost productivity. Despite the enormous socio-economic consequences, he says many people with mental health problems do not seek help for a variety of reasons.

'They fear the stigma of seeking help could be one reason. Another reason can be that they do not trust the available health services will help them overcome their problem.' Van Ommeren said. 'Third, it could be that they do not recognize the problem because their knowledge about mental health problems is limited.'

## Learning Disability Doesn't Mean Learning Failure

If you cannot read and write as well as other students, does that mean you will fail in school and life? Laura Grey, who has , a learning that can lead people to mix up letters and makes reading, writing, and spelling difficult, can be an example. She is proficient in five languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and German. She is also learning Russian, Mandarin Chinese, and Dutch.

As she started developing a that included being an early reader, for a long time nobody thought that her terrible handwriting and bad spelling were or even related to dyslexia. But the later diagnosis didn't prevent her from achieving good results in learning other languages.

Brenda Bernaldez, a specialist for the Office of English Language Programs in Mexico, says that if students are trapped in a situation where they cannot ask for help, they should try to help them deal with it. For students struggling to read and write, she suggests using voice recorders to take notes. She also says there are good apps that let students record and organize voice notes. According to her, the process for people who have a learning disability and want to learn another language doesn't need to be anymore because technology is here to help them .

Laura Grey agrees with Brenda and says that if people are to keep going and overcome difficulties in learning a second , they should give technology a try.

## New Smart Tech Helps Visually Impaired South Koreans Increase Mobility

Busan, South Korea's second-largest city, is using new, inclusive technology devised to bring down barriers to mobility for people who are blind.

Park Hyoung-bae glides his long, white cane along a strip of raised yellow blocks that form a trail through an underground metro station. The tactile paving leads blind commuters from the street to the train platform.

But Park, who is walking arm in arm with his mother, says he doesn't feel capable of traveling far from his home on his own.

The tiles still don't make him feel comfortable.

Information boards, maps, and other signage direct travelers to exits, restrooms, and other station amenities, but all these visual indicators are inaccessible to the 32-year-old. Without help from a family member or a hired guide, he explains, Busan's metro system can be overwhelming. 'I've gotten lost in subway stations and asked people where I am, but sometimes they ignore me, and I have no idea if they've walked away or not, and that makes me feel isolated,' he said. 'It's hard to ask for help as someone who's blind.'

Cities across the globe are installing new ICT, or information and communications technology, that connects public infrastructure with the electronic devices of pedestrians, drivers, and commuters. And some governments are using these systems to make public spaces more accessible for people with disabilities. These initiatives will probably give rise to further improvements.

## What Is It That Separates Our Thought Patterns from Our Ancestors'?

In general, our brains aren't that far removed from our ancestors' counterparts 40,000 years ago. But the specific ways our brains behave are widely different and that's because of how and when we take in information. And it's not just on a multi-millennial scale. The brains of young people now have a different arrangement of synapses to that of their parents because of the comparatively massive amounts of time spent looking at the phone and computer screens.

Some like to point out how children have a reduced memory capacity compared to previous generations as a result. But some futurists see it as a move toward

It's a bit like storing photos on the cloud, or how I can't remember what I meant to be saying because it's on the iPad in front of me instead. But in any case, it suggests that brain behavior is going to evolve to catch up with cutting-edge technology and both will change concurrently.

## Euronews Debates: Can Europe bring health care back from the brink?

Martin Smatana, Associate Fellow for the Health and Economic Growth Program, GLOBSEC, said his concern when it comes to the biggest critique of the EU's response is that the health union 'should have been more ambitious, and go into other areas that we know are going to cause problems,' which he said was first and foremost a shortage of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers.

![Image](/workspaces/Datamaster/diversos/PDFs/arquivos_portal/saidas/Pedagogico-ExtraActivities-ExtraActivitiesW10_OutputExercises/Pedagogico-ExtraActivities-ExtraActivitiesW10_OutputExercises_artifacts/image_000027_3bb5a9b30202343061fd2fc58bc4eea6afc3a9e26b61578f083a5d8bf4c60b64.png)

What the panel agreed on was that the issue of human resources was something that must be prioritized.

'We all believe in digital, but it's human resources, the training, the culture, the incentives, the regulation, it's not just pouring money into new digital tools, gadgets, and provisions,' said Josep Figueras, the director of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.

'There is a major concern. What we should do is use these resources very wisely and in particular with the health workforce,' he added, pointing out that when it comes to mental health, as many as 50 percent of the workforce in some health systems are suffering from PTSD and stress.

'So one of the silver linings is actually realizing finally the need to support the health workforce. Now we must do it, or we are really in trouble.'

Cyrus Engerer was in agreement about the risk facing human resourcing in health care. 'Everything is interlinked,' he said.

'We mentioned the workforce. But the fact is that the EU is losing out on talent because, when it comes to getting more nurses, doctors, health care professionals, we have a system that is blocking these people from coming to the EU, and what are they doing instead, they're going to the United States, to the U.K., they're going to Australia, Canada, and Japan.'

## Recurring Nightmares? Scientists Have Found a Way to Rid You of Them

Sleeping might be as far from resting as you can imagine when you're trapped in a nightmare, especially the kind that keeps coming back to haunt you night after night. It's much worse than the occasional dreams of falling, being naked in public, being chased, looking for a toilet, and losing teeth that a wide majority of people experience during their lives. Those suffering from nightmare disorder have their nights disrupted by , terrible dreams, which fill them up with so much fear and , they are deprived of sleep and rest, which are for good physical and mental health.

While this condition is normally treated with stress reduction such as practicing yoga or meditation and in the most severe cases with psychotherapy, and even

(when someone is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, for instance), scientists have just found a treatment that might finally put an end to recurring nightmares.

In a new report published on October 27 in Current Biology, neuroscientists asked 36 patients suffering from recurring nightmares to practice image rehearsal therapy, or IRT, a technique used in cognitive-behavioral psychology which sees people their nightmares only to reframe the negative of nightmares to give them a positive spin.

Rehearsing this affirmative dream scenario during the day has been proven to reduce nightmares after two or three weeks of doing it, but this technique has only been with 30 percent of patients. neuroscientists really succeed in these experiments, they will for more advances in this area.

## Nigerian Refugees 'Opportunity Villages'

in

The West African country of Niger hosts more than 303,000 refugees and asylum-seekers, most fleeing violence from neighboring Nigeria.

In the southern Maradi region, the U.N.'s refugee agency (UNHCR) and aid group Save the Children have set up camps to help refugees stay safe from the border while also easing the burden on their host community. One of three camps the U.N.'s refugee agency set up in Niger's Maradi region since 2019 is known as an 'opportunity village.' Refugees at these camps, the first of their kind in Niger, have been to a location further from the border, for their safety, and both the refugees and the local population receive aid. The of giving aid

to locals is to reduce their burden from the refugee population and ease any tensions that might otherwise arise from competing for resources. Refugee women are also given small grants to set up shops so they can take care of their families. Safe in the camp since 2019, Ali, one of the refugees, used a grant to set up a , a store selling vegetables, salt, and cooking oil.

Aid groups hope in the so-called Opportunity Villages will eventually become self-sufficient.

But some of the refugee women say they are unable to grow their businesses and other people because there is not enough demand for their services in the camp.

Forty-year-old Nigerian mother of six Jameela Salifou makes a mending clothes with a sewing machine. This she found inside the camp was

Salifou said sometimes they make enough money to buy cassava flour, but it is not every day that they have customers. They are proud of their business because this is how they survive, though.

## With a New Administration, American Comedy Group Creates New Jokes

'I am the most presidential person you will ever see,' says a man in a dark suit and red tie, sounding much like an American ex-president in his arrogance and bossiness. He's sporting the president's characteristic hairdo, resembling the teased bouffant style popular in the 1960s.

These are the Capitol Steps , a Washington political satire comedy group, which for 35 years has been poking fun at political leaders, including the most recent past presidents. And now, with a new chief executive in town, the group has created fresh skits and songs for their performances, which are held mostly in Washington.

'We take an existing song and put new words to it,' explains Elaina Newport, a founding member of the group, who helps write the material. 'We'll try to have a good pun and find something that makes fun of the politician.'

The political humor found a receptive audience. 'I think that we just need to sit back and laugh about it every now and then,' says Mary Tomei, a high school student from New York. 'A little more irreverence would do the country good. It helps to laugh at yourself,' agrees Bob McCunney from Boston.

Besides giving audiences a good laugh, Newport hopes the Capitol Steps can help ease squabbles in a very politically divided America. 'I think political satire can make us all relax and forget nerve-racking situations. And even if you disagree with the person sitting next to you at the show, you can laugh at the same jokes.'

Each and every one of us wakes up in the morning , often toward early mornings or late nights, conservatism or liberalism, reading the news or watching it on TV. Our life's worth of experiences shape us to prefer, understand, and believe certain things when we are confronted with an avalanche of information that is difficult to wade through. It's just easier cognitively and emotionally to only with things we already like. This means that if we are presented with a message that aligns with or confirms our , we are likely to believe it. On the other hand, if that message opposes our biases, we are to think it's false. It also means that if you and I both experience the same media, we could take away completely different meanings and differently to it. Social media presents an extra . Sometimes when we are busy or not really concerned about hunting down the right information, we become to accepting whatever answer is laid out in front of us. When something is complex or difficult to understand, and the media turns it into a familiar narrative for us, we it with wide open arms even if it's false. To sum up, our brains are prone to taking and filling in the blanks of a media story whenever and however they can. What's worse, publishers, advertisers, and tech companies know all of these tricks too. They use them against us all the time to hold or steal our attention. If you've absolutely never fallen prey to fake news or some other kind of misinformation, well, congratulations. But for the rest of us, it's not always easy to spot our brain's thought patterns at work, let alone them.

## Mexico's Day of the Dead Is a Celebration of Life

The Day of the Dead is an iconic celebration when people remember and honor their dearly departed, but with celebration - not sorrow.

Marigolds decorate the streets as music blares from speakers. Adults and children alike dress as skeletons and take photos, capturing the annual joy-filled festivities.

No one knows when the first observance took place, but it is rooted in agriculture-related beliefs from Mexico's pre-Hispanic era. Catholic traditions were incorporated into the celebration after the Spanish conquest in 1521.

Typically, it is an intimate family tradition observed with home altars and visits to local cemeteries to decorate graves with flowers and sugar skulls. People bring their deceased loved ones' favorite food and hire musicians to perform their favorite songs.

But what was a quintessential representation of Mexican culture has been suffering from the influence of American Halloween. Elements from American culture carry a new meaning in the context of the original meaning of the festival.

No way! Of all the arts, it is undeniably clear that poetry is the most inaccessible. Understanding a poem often demands attention and commitment from the reader or listener, something which art forms such as films, novels, and music do not.

I can't stand novels with endless cliffhangers either. The majority of them no longer suit readers' habits. They need to be shorter and more exciting to entice the reader to read on and on.

You think that protest songs date back to the 1960s, with artists like Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie, but as far as I understand, these songs have been around for way longer than that. People have been singing about social problems for centuries.

It is believed that novels allow us to create pictures for ourselves, but films give us images directly. They have many tricks at their fingertips to ensure a maximum effect in a way that the novel doesn't.

## Pop Quiz: Who Makes Money When You Stream A Song Online?

There's going to be more and more revenue attached to streaming, and the number of streaming users is supposed to triple in the next five to ten years. That sounds like a lot of money for the music industry as a whole, but how much money are artists making, especially in comparison to the older days of album sales?

That is where the frustrations begin.

Previously, if you bought a record or a CD or if you downloaded a song that was a one-time purchase, the artist got paid a big or relatively larger lump sum payment all at once. What happens with streaming, though, is it's paid out every time you play the music, so for smaller artists, there isn't a big initial lump sum payment. It's more of an annuity where they get paid over time.

![Image](/workspaces/Datamaster/diversos/PDFs/arquivos_portal/saidas/Pedagogico-ExtraActivities-ExtraActivitiesW10_OutputExercises/Pedagogico-ExtraActivities-ExtraActivitiesW10_OutputExercises_artifacts/image_000046_836bae7ec392a3b43e99b977a3428a604f312bcd4b64982a2d1407ae23fccf6b.png)

Artists could see larger payouts over the long run than they would with traditional album sales, but that can still be frustrating for newer, smaller musicians because they won't see that money right away. For now, a significant number of people aren't being paid for music at all.

I strongly reject this idea. Returning to this subject, we will remind him of a terrible situation that has taken him years to admit to. One's past should never be forgotten or ignored.

On the contrary, in my opinion, if someone enjoys chick flicks, it means that they have a romantic side, and showing it to other people is inevitable. They will do it at some point.

Absolutely! When we contemplate nature, we feel more relaxed and energized to face the inevitable everyday challenges. It's as if we accepted our thoughts, emotions, and sensations with gentle detachment.

## Older Women Are the Fresh Faces of South Korean Influencers

The freshest faces among South Korean influencers are no longer the usual 20-something celebrities. Instead, entertainment and social media are focusing on a new generation: the elder one. Older women were once invisible in South Korean entertainment as the industry stuck to rigidly conservative devoted mothers. But older women have played a significant role in recent advertising and entertainment series.

A pioneer in the trend is Oscar winner

Youn Yuh-Jung, the 74-year-old 'Minari' actor who endorsed Oriental Brewery TM  beer and the Zig Zag TM shopping app in two recent ad campaigns.

Park Makrye, a popular South Korean YouTuber, said that people's attitude towards gender and age has been rapidly changing worldwide.

'Back in the day, people thought women were supposed to be only housewives cooking at home, but that's once upon a time. Older women often don't want to be the big fish in a small pond. They want to broaden their horizons and people must adapt to the current era,' she said. Park's engagement in this cause has paved the way for others. Jang Myung-sook gives out fashion and lifestyle tips on her channel and shares personal stories about living through the Japanese colonization, and a 76-year-old YouTuber flaunts her single life on G-gourmet. 'I would like to tell grandmothers to try everything they want to do and not be concerned with their age,' Park told The Associated Press.

Perhaps you have a point here, Joe. Although my life hasn't been a bed of roses, I have a lot to be thankful for. I should focus on the positive things and be patient with the ones that can't be changed at the touch of a button.

I would say the opposite. More and more labor-saving devices will be invented soon and it will help you save money as well. They are expensive, but don't forget that time is money. You will end up having more time to spend the way you want.

Most of the people surveyed said that they believe distraction may be caused by mental health issues, but being distracted doesn't mean that someone lacks commitment.

Although I have a different opinion on the subject, I will side with you on one point. Most families remain as close as they were decades ago, aided by technology and greater flexibility in working patterns.

## Does Birth Order Affect Your Personality?

In two huge studies published in 2015, scientists were able to tons of different kids across lots of different families. One of the studies looked at almost 400,000 U.S. high school students, and the other included over 20,000 students from the United States, U.K., and Germany. The one difference they found, and if you are an older I expect you to hold this over your younger siblings, was a small variation in intellect, which is considered one of the sub-traits of in the big five. Siblings born first tend to have a slightly higher IQ than siblings born later. We're talking about just a couple of points. It could come from firstborn kids getting a little bit more direct attention from their parents at an age, but as mentioned before here on SciShowPsych , IQ is just one way to measure learning . It's only one part of the complex of intelligence as it can be affected by a lot of different things, like how motivated you are to do well on the test. And other studies looking at big sets of data haven't been able to present a birth order on IQ in an way. Most psychologists treat birth order theory with a healthy these days, although it hasn't been totally . Birth order might be an appealing way to explain differences in the behavior of siblings, but when we look across large groups of families, the effects aren't there. You might know individual people who fit the stereotype of an oldest sibling who's more responsible or a youngest who seems . But there are also plenty of responsible youngest children or oldest children who act like total brats.

I won't contradict you, not only because I know which side my bread is buttered on, but also because you are right when you say that a multigenerational workforce can make our company more responsive and attractive to customers of all ages.

I would like to add that it won't happen. I believe that by the end of the decade, we will have a multigenerational workforce.

By the time you realize how important it is to show customers what we're here for, it may be too late. This is the zero hour. Otherwise, we will have problems with our customers.

## Messy Room, Messy Brain?

Nobody does messy rooms quite like teenagers. So are the majority of teenagers misunderstood future creative geniuses? Well, it may just be that teen brains haven't quite got there yet cognitively - when it comes to sticking to a clean-up routine. Things like controlling impulsiveness, seeing things from other people's points of view, and understanding consequences, all take time to be learned. However, one concern is that there's a darker warning lurking behind the pile of clothes on the floor. That messy room might not be a sign of expressing independence or a lack of cognitive skills, but a fundamental indication that the person who owns the bits and pieces in a mess lacks self-control. Why bother with something so trivial? Well, self-control has been shown to be one of the best predictors of future success time and time again. Ultimately, the only way to judge the effectiveness of your messy creativity is to go out and experiment for yourself. So, go ahead, make it rain with all your important files and paperwork, and have fun! See what you come up with afterward.
