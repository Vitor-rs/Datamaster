## WELCOME TO WIZARD ON

Wizard by Pearson, the largest language school in Latin America, presents a new experience: Wizard On.

Students are our most precious asset and it is our responsibility to carry and deliver the best learning journey for them. We are committed to not only developing students' skills, but also to creating and providing successful learning experiences.

Wizard On aims to combine a virtual environment, including a live class, with a unique methodology. Recently, there has been a substantial growth in virtual education. Virtual learning environments have become available to all ages and are increasingly reaching a larger audience. As technology becomes more accessible all over the world, education is being redefi  ned.

In turn, students are looking for an educational experience that involves technological resources and facilities. Wizard On meets these needs and goals of the 21 st  century learning context, all while remaining loyal to Wizard's successful methodology.

For more than 30 years, our methodology has what made Wizard by Pearson unique. Students learn by being exposed to the target language and its structures, and by interacting with teacher and classmates. At Wizard, this is supported by a combination of specially designed teacher training and teaching techniques and approaches. For Wizard On , our methodology remains the same.

In Wizard On teachers and students can interact in real time. Most of the online courses available in the market work asynchronously, allowing students to learn according to their own schedule, but this creates a gap between students' and teachers' interaction. In Wizard On the content is delivered live while students respond live, making it a Live Online Experience.

Wizard On has many other advantages compared to other online language teaching platforms. Its exclusive classes and schedules, supported by traditional coursebooks and digital homework, combine self-study and in-class experiences. Students can count on our dedicated teachers and rely on the security and exclusivity of the platform.

Read the following instructions to discover how to deliver your Wizard On class and help your students achieve success, wherever they study.

Enjoy!

## GUIDELINES FOR TEACHERS

## General Instructions for the Virtual Classes

These instructions aim to guide you to deliver the best Wizard On class. It is worth mentioning that, in addition to this document, traditional Teacher's Guide textbooks continue to be the main source of content for your classes. Therefore, both this guideline and the Teacher's Guides are essential for delivering the Wizard On classes.

The following hints are essential for your Wizard On class preparation:

1. Remember that at any moment in class, cameras can be turned on to better see and check students' production.
2. Microphones will only be muted if the teacher requires the students to do so.
3. Depending on the activity, the teacher will send the students to a breakout room where they must work according to the teacher's instructions.
4. Each activity shows a time/minute suggestion: this might help with time management. It is also possible to turn on the stopwatch tool provided by the platform.
5. While students are in the breakout rooms, the teacher must enter and leave, visiting them, checking their progress, and helping them out if needed.
6. Assessment is constant and necessary in Wizard On classes, and will be carried out in every class, addressing the four skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. There should be continuous follow-up with frequent feedback and development of PDI ( Plano de Desenvolvimento Individual ) if necessary.
7. Drilling practice is one of the main features of the Wizard methodology, and it remains in Wizard On . It must be carried out in groups, as it will be explained further on in this document, so that the teacher can listen to all students and ensure that everyone is practicing.
8. There are specifi  c features such as Private Rooms, Breakout Rooms, and Virtual Board that are used as tools to help the teacher assist students in dealing with exercises more appropriately.

•••

9. Monitoring students requires more refi  ned attention from the teacher. As there is no oral homework correction, the teacher needs to pay close attention to each small sign of diffi culty or students' disengagement.
10. Virtual Study Hall is a good strategy to help the teacher to boost students' motivation, engagement, or language level. It also provides a solid moment to help students with doubts they may have about the homework.
11. To maintain good teacher and student interaction in the virtual environment, planning and applying constant feedback is essential. The warm-up, closing, peer work, teacher support moment, among other, are also good times to help students become aware of their development.
12. The maximum number of students per class is 12 from Wizard On - Connections Experience.
13. Classes must have a fi  xed schedule in order to create a feeling of belonging among students, and consequently increase engagement.

## Introducing the Conversation Clubs

In addition to providing students with a wide range of meaningful and eff  ective lessons, Wizard On also off  ers an opportunity for students to practice and get to know other students through the Conversation Clubs .

As in real life, communicating in a diff  erent language requires being prepared to experience diff  erent things and interact with diff  erent people. In order to make this integration happen successfully, Wizard schools must be prepared in terms of scheduling, facilities, and equipment logistics, such as fi  nding the most convenient and suitable day and time for the gatherings. It is also essential to provide teachers with access to a computer and a projector, so they can present slides during the events.

You may like  to also invite students from Connections and Interactive experiences to participate in the Clubs, making sure they belong to the same level as the corresponding Conversation Club classes  (only W2 students should enroll in W2 Conversation Clubs, for example).

![Image](/workspaces/Datamaster/diversos/PDFs/arquivos_portal/saidas/Pedagogico-GestaoAcademica-WizardON-WizardON_GeneralInstructionsForTeachers/Pedagogico-GestaoAcademica-WizardON-WizardON_GeneralInstructionsForTeachers_artifacts/image_000003_7e59602b5cd98d4712ca300335e751ea0024199ef94c174ed78a7dcc54db4580.png)

According to the principles of Andragogy, adults do only what is relevant to them. Be sure to show students the relevance of the themes, and that the outcomes of the Conversation Clubs will have an impact on their spoken English skills and their lives, so that they will participate in them. We also recommend that you decorate the school accordingly, to create an engaging environment.

## General Instructions for the Homework

The homework is divided into Input, Output, and Review. Input and Review homework lessons are the same as in students' Workbook pages, with images and audio to reinforce students' learning of vocabulary and grammar. They were adapted to the online experience, and they are found at wizathome.brightspace.com .

The platform corrects students' answers in activities such as multiple choice, true or false, ordering, and matching. Teachers must check and grade all students' answers, and then transfer their scores to Sponte. Watch the video of the guided tour of the platform for more information.

The output homework lessons remain on Wiz.me , the personal assistant, to practice and improve diff  erentiated aspects of the language.

Wiz.me also off  ers tools that help students improve pronunciation and fl  uency. They can record their voice, listen to their recordings, do extra activities, and even check a dictionary.

Note: as previously mentioned, students' homework should not be corrected in class. The ten-minute homework correction will be turned into other class procedures. Even though there is no homework correction, it is of great importance to give your students feedback. This way, you can provide them with a sense of accomplishment, suggest improvements, or even ask them to review specifi  c content. Keep in mind that feedback is given for help and improvement purposes, not punishment.

## Wizard On + Connections | Class preparation

When preparing a Wizard On class, it is essential to keep in mind that the principles of Wizard by Pearson Methodology must be preserved.

Dealing with virtual teaching demands much more from the teacher in terms of class preparation. The focus is not only on the topics, exercises, and steps of the class. It is also necessary to consider the factors that can infl  uence the class dynamics, such as the class profi  le, which must be well known by the teacher responsible for the class. The teacher should also be aware of the technological issues that may interfere, positively or negatively, in the experience.

Read ahead the steps toward successful class preparation for a Wizard On + Connections experience.

## a. Teacher's formal class preparation

Using the Wizard by Pearson provided forms, the teacher must organize and prepare the Learning objectives, structure models, contextualization, resources, extra materials, and self-assessment to be used during the class.

1. Learning objectives: the summary of LOs can be found at the beginning of each batch of lessons; the full list is divided into the lessons. It is important that the teacher reads the LOs before each lesson in order to help students to achieve them.
2. Structure models: the teacher may anticipate issues and doubts related to the vocabulary, phrases, and functions that are about to be studied and practiced by the students during the scheduled lesson. The teacher should read the modelling sentences , key words, and functions from the class beforehand, and prepare to provide examples and contextualize them if necessary.
3. Contextualization: this is one of the main principles of Wizard by Pearson's methodology, when the teacher introduces a new topic, taking into consideration the group profi  le. For example, to explain the idea of for breakfast / for lunch / for dinner , fi  rst the teacher must provide a model, such as I eat bread and cheese for breakfast. / I eat pasta for lunch. And you? What do you eat for breakfast?

4. Resources and extra materials: for classes at the school, the teacher must separate, in advance, audio devices, realia, posters, and everything else necessary to be used throughout the class. For Wizard On , the procedure is very similar. Teachers need to separate the extra material that is going to be needed, but they must check that: a) all the fi  les are converted to .pdf extension. b) if there are any fi  les that may be corrupted or damaged.
5. Checking: the teacher must select the sentences that are going to be used along throughout class, study them, and have to hand during the class. To provide a productive and enjoyable experience, the teacher must study the Teacher's Guide and fi  nd out the topic order. This way the teacher will be able to guide the students through the learning points, allowing them to naturally build their own idea of the language and become owners of their learning process.
6. Last checking: after the class, the teacher should take the class profi  le into consideration and its own sense of achievement. It is the teacher's job to raise awareness on what was successful during the class and what needs to be improved.

## b. Class environment and devices

When you turn the class environment from a physical space into a virtual one, students are required to adjust their mindset. In contrast to a class in the school facilities, in a virtual class we deal with a range of new elements and situations that we may not be used to. It is very important to consider that the students' behavior may change in this transition.

1. We are inside the student's environment: it is very important to remember that in this new experience we are the ones who are going to the students, while they are, most of the time, in their comfort zone. This means that we need to provide resources and conditions necessary to capture students' attention and ensure that they produce and develop the language with the same effi ciency as the inschool classes. With this objective in mind, it is very important to:

•••

- Check if your Internet connection is stable and powerful enough to provide a good streaming fl  ow.
- Be sure that the device and resources (videos, images) you are about to use with your class are compatible with the tech requirements of the platform.
- Check if your camera and audio devices are working properly to avoid pixilation and echo during the class.
- Be sure that you are completely familiarized with the platform audio, video, messaging, and fi  le sharing resources.
2. The range of school's image is wider: from the moment you start working with virtual streaming you are allowing people, who may not always be  students, to have access not only to your image, but also to your work and, consequently, to the quality of Wizard by Pearson's products. In order to preserve your and the company's image, it is essential that you:
- Respect the dress code - remember to dress as you were teaching to an in-school audience.
- Be aware of your posture - when speaking in front of the camera remember that you are being observed all the time. Pay attention to your body language in order to show confi  dence and hospitality to your public.
- Be aware of your voice volume - it is very common to feel that the person who is watching you is not listening to you clearly, and, as a result, raise our voice volume. If you do not feel very secure about how loud or quiet your voice sounds, ask a coworker to perform a test with you and give you feedback, so you can fi  nd the most suitable volume to be used in your classes.
- Organize your room - this shows respect for your audience. Pay attention to the layout of your background, objects on the table, and other details. Students will notice that you prepared the environment to meet them.
- Think about lighting - a well illuminated environment provides a comfortable virtual learning environment since the audience's eyes do not get tired trying to adapt to shadows.

Note: do not close the virtual room until all your students have left. By doing this, students will be sure that you are available for them until the very last minute of your class.

## c. The Wizard On student

As mentioned earlier in this guide, education is being redefi  ned as technology improves, and students are looking for educational experiences that involve technological resources; this leads us to conclude that the Wizard On student is not only looking for a diff  erent way of learning, but also a new way of studying.

The class preparation performed by our students, especially when they reach a level in which the use of Portuguese is no longer used, is a premise that is going to be kept, but adapted to attend to this new student profi  le. So, from Lesson 61 (New W4) on, students can count on the CLASS PREPARATION CARD on Wiz.me , which will help them get prepared for their Wizard On classes.

## Feedback

Formal feedback must be given to Wizard On students once a month, ideally after the Review lessons. This step, in addition to fostering trust and strengthening the student-teacher relationship, also adheres to one of the premises of Wizard methodology formative/procedural assessment.

This moment must be accompanied by the records made by the teacher and supported by the strategies already planned with and agreed by the student.

## Suggested steps for a feedback session with students

Student feedback is essential so that his/her motivation and dedication to continue the course is always high. Reminding him/her of how much he/she has progressed and how much he/she can still grow is extremely important within the reenrollment process.

Read ahead the suggested steps for a feedback session held at a scheduled time with the student. Remember that it should happen after the Review lesson, and it should last approximately 15 minutes.

## For the main steps:

- a. Schedule with student
- b. Generate a link on the platform
- c. Execution

## Detailed steps:

1. Open the conversation and establish an empathetic relationship with the student. For this, the teacher/coordinator must be friendly and polite, trying to understand how the student is and how he/she feels during this period in Wizard On .
2. Explain the reason for this meeting, which is to talk about the student's development during the period he/she is studying, comparing his/her performance to that at the beginning of the period, the moment he/she is in, what to expect, and how to  get the most out of the upcoming classes.
3. Describe the events of the period with facts and data. For this, it is important that the student's Report Card is very well fi  lled out, with the updated scores, and containing all the necessary information about the student, and his/her performance within the studied book/level, as well as other notes made by the teacher.
4. Show the student the impact of what he/ she has learned, linking this impact to the student's goal of learning another language. Point out what he/she is already capable of doing with the learned content. For this moment, the teacher can use the opening (spread) pages from W2 and W4 or the Table of Contents as a starting point for discussions that lead the student to visualize his/her accomplishments.
5. Ask the student to talk about his/her perception of his/her learning and the period in which he/she is studying. At this moment, the teacher/coordinator must work on active listening, giving space for the student to speak honestly about his/her perceptions and carrying out the necessary interventions for the fl  uidity of the conversation.

6. Off  er suggestions for the student to continue performing well or to improve the points that need attention. Create a plan for the next steps. Focus on the pedagogical processes and create a PDI (Plano de Desenvolvimento Individual) with the student. This PDI should include what aspects need attention in the learning process and which are the recommendations for the student to evolve in his/her learning
7. Confi  rm with the student that the points are agreed and understood, and that the deadlines for reaching these objectives and future feedback sessions are clear. Ask if he/ she has any questions or wants to make any suggestions.
8. Thank the student for attending the meeting and wish him/her well.

Note: if you prefer to deliver the formal feedback in person, Conversation Club is a great opportunity to do so.

## VIRTUAL STUDY HALL

The virtual classes scenario requires careful attention to detail in order maintain the quality of our classes and our students' engagement and learning; therefore, all Wizard schools that implement Wizard On should have Virtual Study Hall.

The Virtual Study Hall is an online support, provided after students' regular class, that is guided by a teacher or a monitor, with a maximum of ten students in the virtual room. These students may be selected by their teachers or they may choose to participate at their own will.

As previously mentioned, there is no Homework correction during class and that is one of the main reasons why the Virtual Study Hall is important for the Wizard On business model. It can be used in the following situations:

- to help students who are not producing according to their level;
- for students to clear up doubts about the content and homework;
- to help students with the class preparation.

Coordinators and teachers have an essential role to provide the best experience for students; therefore, certain steps must be followed.

## Coordinators:

1. Create a schedule with a fi  xed time and the names of the teachers/monitors who are going to monitor during Virtual Study Hall.

Note: the students will only be allowed to enter the room through the external link provided by the platform.

2. Encourage students to participate in the Virtual Study Hall meetings.
3. Send invitations and reminders about the Virtual Study Hall meetings.
4. Create the virtual rooms and send the link to students and teachers.
5. Monitor the participation and learning results during your individual meetings with the teachers.

## Teachers/monitors:

1. Prepare the meeting taking into consideration the students who are going to attend it and select the main points that you must cover.
2. Begin your meeting by introducing yourself and asking the students' names to create a rapport with them.
3. During the class, take a few minutes to talk to each one privately, helping to answer their questions. The platform's private room can be used for this.
4. As soon as the class fi  nishes, the teacher or the monitor should report the students' progress to their respective teachers.

By following the steps above, it is possible to have better learning results and assure that students are having all the support that they need.  Breakout rooms may be used in order to help students feel more comfortable about asking questions and to address their individual needs.

## ZERO CLASS

What is the school's role in the student's onboarding process?

The Wizard school will be warned by Sponte approved system of a new student enrollment. At this moment, the school must schedule the student's Onboarding, following these steps:

1. The school building should always be ready to welcome new students and returning ones. High levels of cleanliness should be maintained at all times, and the furniture should be organized and comfortable. Upon entering the school, students must feel like they are in an atmosphere of trust and, importantly, of learning. The school gets in contact with the student to schedule his/her Onboarding. (Zero Class)
2. When receiving a Wizard On student, make sure he/she speaks with a school representative (the school coordinator, for example) in order to clear up any doubts he/she may have while getting to know the school. At this moment (Onboarding), the school will present the payment options for the remaining installments.
3. The representative will take the student on a tour of the school , using this moment to show how the school, even from a distance, is engaged with his/her quality of education. It is always recommended that the school has some boards on the walls with pictures of events and teachers to be used by the representative to demonstrate that students learn and that the school is on standby to provide the best kind of support. In addition, you may like to consider off  ering some water and/or coff  ee to make this student feel welcome and special.
4. Since the Contact Center will not be able to evaluate intermediate or advanced students' profi  ciency levels, some students will have to take the placement test at schools.
5. At this moment, the closing of the sale must be done with the marketing consultant and payment for the course and course material received (the enrollment tax will have already been paid online).
6. Upon fi  nishing the enrollment, you may like to take the student to a classroom or to a place in the reception where there is a computer, so the representative can navigate the virtual platform with the student at the same time as giving him/her the books.
7. It is extremely important that the student leaves the school with his/her books and without any questions/doubts, especially related to where to fi  nd his/her login and password and how to access the platform. Therefore, the Zero Class is an opportunity to have initial contact with the student and ensure that he/she:
- a. knows exactly what Wizard On is;
- b. knows how the Wizard by Pearson methodology works;
- c. receives his/her books. If the placement test is taken at this moment, it is possible that the school will not have the books;

Note: in the case of the student doing the placement test during the Zero Class, Pearson will send the student's material in the week following enrollment.

- d. has his/her login and password and uses them to access the platform;
- e. knows about Wiz.me, the personal digital assistant, and experiences its tools;
- f. knows who his/her teacher will be, and if possible, meets him/her personally;

Tip: if the teacher is not at school, you can show a recorded video of each teacher to the new students. The teacher could also be asked to record the video with the student's name and send it afterward;

- g. knows how to access the class and, if the school off  ers a Virtual Study Hall schedule (recommended), explain to the student how he/she can participate;
- h. is aware of the digital Homework and how it works;

Note: it is important to remember that digital Homework is only available for W2 and W4 New Editions at this moment.

- i. knows clearly how he/she will be evaluated (Report Card, FALE, etc.);
- j. knows how he/she will receive feedback and how he/she can be submitted to an improvement class;
- k. is aware of the importance of  the class preparation and how to do it. Remember to show the student the Class Preparation Card;

- l. is informed that is he/she is placed in a group with a fi  xed schedule and that he/she needs to communicate to the school when it is not possible to participate. He/she must be informed about the policy of catch up classes, attendance, charges for replacement classes (if applicable), and the school calendar with the beginning and the end of classes;
- m. has the school contacts to ask for help in case he/she faces diffi culties;
- n. has all the necessary information about what the Conversation Club is, its importance for his/her learning process, as well as the dates for the events;
- o. leaves with the conviction that Wizard is committed to his/her learning process.

Best Practice: some schools have transformed the Zero Class process into a Student Guide and request the student's signature after this conversation, in order to confi  rm their awareness of and commitment to the process.

8. This fi  rst contact is an excellent opportunity to get to know the student better. The school must ask what has inspired him/her to start this second language study, what his/her dream/goal is, what his/her preferences are (songs, series, movies, hobbies, etc.), and record this information on the student's form, in order to be used as a resource for class preparation and feedback.
9. If necessary, all steps above can be done online as well, using the platform.

## GUIDELINES FOR TEACHERS

## Pedagogical General Instructions for the Useful Language Lesson - W2

This is the fi  rst lesson of the new W2. The Useful Language lesson aims to break the ice with students and present what is expected during the learning process. You must ensure that your students leave this class feeling that they belong to the group and with all their questions answered about how the Wizard On class works.

Note: remember to leave your camera open during the whole class and encourage students to do the same.

•••

Icebreaker | Students will play a game during the fi  rst minutes of the class to promote integration and help them feel comfortable.  As it is their fi  rst class, carry out the activity in Portuguese. You can either use the suggestion below or choose any other game that you fi  nd more appropriate for the group's profi  le, provided that that fi  ts the time proposed.

Guessing Game | To start this game, all students must have their camera open. Explain that they are going to work in pairs and ask them to look at each other closely for a few seconds. When the time is up, ask them to close their cameras and start asking the following questions to each of them about their peers:

Qual é a cor dos olhos dele/dela? Que roupa ele/ela está usando? O que mais te chamou a atenção nele/nela?

Listen to their answers and students confi  rm if they are right or wrong. Make sure all your students participate. If necessary, put them in trios.

Course Overview | Now that students know each other a little better, it is time to tell them a little more about their course. Give students a quick overview of the following topics in order to familiarize them with aspects of the coursebook, materials, and procedures that are relevant to their successful learning.

1. Types of lessons: Explain the structure of each type of lesson: input lessons, output lessons, and Review lessons.
2. Attendance sheet, Report Card, and grading criteria: Briefl  y explain how you report their attendance and performance and how grading takes place at Wizard.
3. Regular and catch-up classes: Emphasize the importance of attending regular classes, but also let them know they must do catch-up classes, using Wiz.me, if they miss a regular one.
4. Study program: Recommend a balanced study routine according to their class schedule and reinforce that you will regularly remind them of the importance of keeping a consistent studying routine.
5. Wiz.me: Instruct them on how to make good use of their Personal Assistant Wiz.me and highlight all its benefi  ts  \_  audio and content for extra practice.

![Image](/workspaces/Datamaster/diversos/PDFs/arquivos_portal/saidas/Pedagogico-GestaoAcademica-WizardON-WizardON_GeneralInstructionsForTeachers/Pedagogico-GestaoAcademica-WizardON-WizardON_GeneralInstructionsForTeachers_artifacts/image_000006_7e59602b5cd98d4712ca300335e751ea0024199ef94c174ed78a7dcc54db4580.png)

Useful Language | Ask students to open their books to pages 6 and 7 at Useful Language. Divide them into groups of three, depending on how many students you have, it can be two or four. Read the commands and phrases in English and have each group read after you in unison, for example:

Teacher: Group 1, leia depois de mim: Excuse me. Group 1: Excuse me. Teacher: Group 2, leia depois de mim: Sorry! Group 2: Sorry! Teacher: Group 1, Please. Group 1: Please.

Note: this procedure aims to listen to each student without delay or connection interference, so you will be able to evaluate and guide them individually according to their needs.

Follow this step twice. Then tell students you will read the same commands and phrases, but this time you will say them in Portuguese in the order they appear and they must say each one in English. Remember to call on each group at a time. Follow this step twice.

Next, make sure all students understand the commands and phrases by asking them for examples at random. They are allowed and expected to use the images and translations provided if needed. Ask if they have any diffi culty and reinforce the correct pronunciation of words they may fi  nd challenging. You don't need to go through all of the content.

After fi  nishing the activity, go to Drilling practice.

Drilling Practice | Substitution Practice. Still divided into groups, have students alternately reproduce in unison each drill. Encourage them by modeling the exercise:

Teacher: Vamos praticar! Eu falo em português e vocês em inglês. Group 1, como eu falo: Oi! / Olá! / E aí? Agora Group 2, digam: Tchau! / Até mais! The complete drilling practice is in the Teacher's Guide.

Now explain to students that they are going to work in pairs. They are supposed to take turns using the commands and phrases responding to their classmates. For example, if Student A says Look! , Student B should say Look! , or if Student A says Bye. , Student B waves and replies Bye . or See you. , etc.

For this activity, you should create breakout rooms for each pair and guide them to practice for fi  ve minutes. During this time, visit as many breakout rooms as you can, to keep up with their practice. It is not a problem if you can't visit them all. These activities are great opportunities for students to develop their autonomy. To wrap up, read the Useful Language content one more time so that students can practice saying the sentences in the same groups that they were at the beginning of the class. Explain that there is no Homework for this lesson, but they may want to look over Lesson 1 to prepare for it.

## Pedagogical General Instructions for the input lessons -New W2

Input lessons aim to present the new content. There are three of them in each batch of lessons. For satisfactory retention of the content, make sure students fi  nish the input lesson classes knowing how to use the content in everyday-life situations. In other words, bring the content to their reality.

Note: remember to leave your camera open during the whole class and encourage students to do the same.

Assessment | (Except for Lesson 1) Before introducing the new content in the input lesson, read the questions or statements in this section for assessing and recalling content from the previous lesson. Read each sentence in English, in Portuguese, and then in English again. Ask for volunteers to turn on their microphones and answer the questions. Avoid pointing to a specifi  c student. By asking the whole group the questions, you will make them comfortable to contribute. Example:

Teacher:

I study Spanish. What about you? / Eu estudo espanhol. E você? / I study Spanish. What about you?

Volunteer:

I don't study Spanish. I study English.

Spread Page | Tell students to keep their microphone on. Ask them to observe the picture and tell you what they think the corresponding batch of lessons will be about. Read the theme and Learning Objectives, and translate them to Portuguese, if necessary. Students don't need to read with you, but make sure they understand everything and have no questions. You may now ask them to turn the page to the new lesson. The presentation of this section will only happen at the beginning of the fi  rst lesson of each batch.

## Prepare for the following activities

Divide students into groups for the following sections: Verbs, New Words, Useful Phrases, Grammar, Real Life, Check it out!, and the drilling practice. Therefore, you can assure every student participates and has the opportunity to check their understanding while practicing in groups. Examples on how to make group divisions:

- if you have 12 students, you can divide the class into four groups of three students;
- if you have eight students, you can divide the class into two groups of four students or divide the class into four pairs;
- if you have six students, you can divide the class into two trios or divide the class into three pairs.

Verbs | Divide students into two, three, or four small groups, according to how many students you have. Read the verbs in English and have each group read after you in unison, one group at a time. For example:

```
Teacher: Group 3, read after me: to drink Group 3: to drink Teacher: Group 2: to eat Group 2: to eat Teacher: Group 1, read after me: to drink Group 1: to drink
```

•••

Make sure all the groups practice at random. Follow this step twice. Next, read the verbs in Portuguese and have each group read them in English after you in unison. Follow this step twice. Go to the Drilling Practice for the Verbs section, following the group practice strategy.

New Words | Read the words in English and have each group read after you in unison, one group at a time. Follow this step twice. Then read the words in Portuguese and have each group read them in English after you in unison one at a time. Follow this step twice. Check students' understanding of the words and choose the ones they found more challenging to read again. Ask students to read after you in unison one more time to reinforce the correct pronunciation. Go to the Drilling Practice for the New Words section, following the group practice strategy.

Useful Phrases | Read the sentences in English and have each group read after you in unison, one group at a time. Follow this step twice. Read the sentences in Portuguese and have each group read them in English after you in unison one at a time. Follow this step twice. Then draw their attention to the words and/or phrases in bold (when the lesson contains such items), and check students' understanding of their meaning and use. Contextualize them, providing more examples. Go to the Drilling Practice for the Useful Phrases section, following the group practice strategy.

Grammar | Read the sentences in English and have each group read after you in unison, one group at a time. Follow this step twice. Read the sentences in Portuguese and have each group read them in English after you in unison one at a time. Follow this step only once. Draw their attention to the words and/or phrases in bold, checking students' understanding of their meaning and use. Provide more examples following the pattern provided in the lesson. Go to the Drilling Practice for the Grammar section, following the group practice strategy.

Real Life | Before you read the sentences, draw students' attention to the images in the section and ask them to tell you what they see; they must keep their microphones on to participate. They should come up with words, fragments, or phrases related to what they learned. Then read the sentences and have students read them in unison with their microphones muted. Next, put them in pairs. First, they should read the sentences just as they are to each other. Then read again, but replace some of the words in the sentences this time. They may substitute any words they like, provided they use the content they are learning or the content from previous lessons. For this activity, you should create breakout rooms for each pair and guide them to practice for fi  ve minutes. During this time, visit as many breakout rooms as you can, to keep up with their practice. It is not a problem if you can't visit them all. These activities are great opportunities for students to develop their autonomy. If time allows, ask students to create new sentences related to the pictures. Ask some of them for example sentences.

Check it out! | Read the content in the Check it out! section and have each group read after you in unison, one group at a time. Check students' understanding of the given words / phrases, relating them to the content introduced in the lesson. Ask students, at random, to provide examples.

Input Feedback (Spread Page) | Before you give the homework instructions, ask students to open their books to the spread page of the respective batch of lessons. Read the Learning Objectives (LOs) to students and translate to Portuguese if needed. Ask students if they think they have accomplished what is being asked/said. If they answer positively, have them put a checkmark on the corresponding LO. If they feel insecure or doubtful about a topic that was delivered, provide some examples so they can relate to it, and recall the topic. The list of LOs follows an order of appearance in the lessons. Once you get to a LO that is still to be covered, students will respond to it negatively, so you may stop reading the list and leave the LOs blank from this point on. See the example:

Teacher:

Let's see. '... name some kinds of food and drink.' Nomear alguns tipos de comida e bebida. Nós aprendemos isso na aula de hoje? Have we learned about this today?

Students:

Yes!

Teacher:

Great. Put a checkmark! Let's continue. '... say what you prefer and love.' Dizer o que preferimos e amamos. Have we learned about this? Nós aprendemos sobre isso?

Students:

No.

Teacher:

Right. So, this is for the next class. Então vamos ver isso nas próximas aulas. Vamos deixar em branco.

Make sure all students keep their microphones open during this activity.

Last Checking | To raise students' sense of progress, ask questions individually, such as:

- Tell me what you learned today.
- Make two sentences using the content that we've seen today.
- What did you most like learning today?
- Tell me three diff  erent words that you saw in today's lesson.
- Did you learn a lot today? What did you learn?
- How are you going to use this content in your daily life?

Homework Instructions| Explain to students how to do their Homework on the platform. Remind them that they may clear up any doubts and ask for more guidance about their Homework in the Virtual Study Hall.

## Pedagogical General Instructions for the output lessons - W2

Read ahead the basic guidance to perform the output lesson exercises. You should be aware that, even though some activities have the same name, they may have diff  erent purposes, steps, and approaches; that's why it is important to read the related lesson in the Teacher's Guide for the complete procedure.

Listen and Practice | This activity aims to work on listening skills, as well as pronunciation accuracy and sentence structure. Before reading the sentences, display the images on the virtual board and ask students to describe what they see (vocabulary only). Explain that they are going to listen to six sentences, and they must relate each one to a corresponding image. Then read the sentences again, so that students can write down each statement. You may read the sentences one more time if needed. Correct the activity. As a pronunciation practice, read the sentences with pauses and ask students to say them aloud. In the case of mispronunciation and/or bad intonation, draw their attention to the correct pattern, following the appropriate correction technique.

Speak Right Now | This exercise aims to work on communication structure and correctness. You must divide your students into groups. Read the sentences and the words in the cases, and have them read after you in unison, one group at a time. Next, tell them to work in pairs, following the example with the verb 'to eat': Student A chooses a word from the box and makes a sentence, to which student B responds. They are supposed to take turns. Once they fi  nish the fi  rst part, ask them to go to the second one, and work with the verbs to eat and to drink. For the practice in pairs, you should create a breakout room for each pair and guide them to practice for fi  ve minutes. During this time, visit as many breakout rooms as you can, to keep up with their practice. It is not a problem if you cannot visit them all. These activities are great opportunities for students to develop their autonomy.

Fluency | This exercise aims to help students develop strategies for fl  uency and sentence structure. Divide students into groups. Read the sentences in the fi  rst part and ask each group at a time to read after you in unison. After that, explain what students are supposed to do next and check if they understand the task. Working in pairs, Student A reads the given sentence and Student B responds accordingly. They should take turns as they practice. Once they have fi  nished the fi  rst part, draw their attention to the second part of the activity. Follow the same steps mentioned above, starting from the reading of the sentences. If you need to correct pronunciation and/or structure, draw their attention to the accurate patterns, following the appropriate correction technique.

•••

Express Yourself | This activity intends to make students practice and see structures being used in a real-life situation, as well as see a clear model of how they can use the content they have learned so far. Before reading the content, point to the image on the virtual board and ask students to tell you what they see or what comes to their mind when they see this particular situation. With books still open, read the content while students only listen. Ask them to pay attention to the fl  ow of the dialogue, the intonation, and how words are pronounced. Read it one more time, so students can practice speaking each sentence aloud. In pairs, ask students to take turns reading the sentences aloud and shifting roles. For a third reading, ask students to substitute the words in bold for their personal information. Check on their performance as they practice. If you need to correct pronunciation and/or structure, draw their attention to the accurate patterns, following the appropriate correction technique.

There and Around | Draw students' attention to the comic strip on the virtual board. Engage them in a brainstorming session, asking students information such as where the characters are, what they are doing, who they are, etc. Then read the lines in the speech boxes and have students read after you in unison. Check their understanding, and then put them in pairs in a breakout room. Ask students to open Wiz.me, access the Recording card, and do a quick roleplay using the phrases they learned. Tell them to record their practice and listen to themselves speaking. The have fi  ve minutes to practice. During this time, visit as many breakout rooms as you can, to keep up with their practice. It is not a problem if you can't visit them all. These activities are great opportunities for students to develop their autonomy. If time allows, you may explore other options for asking and answering.

Improve your Pronunciation | This exercise will make students work on the pronunciation of some sounds, linking, and intonation. In this specifi  c activity, they will work on linking sounds. It is essential to draw their attention to what they will be working on. Read the content and have students read after you. Read the content one more time and tell them to pay attention to the sounds. Tell them to listen and say this list at home several times. The more they practice, the more they become aware of the sounds and able to understand others and be understood.

Questions | The aim of this activity is for students to chat with their peers more freely, so they feel they can communicate in a real-life context. Read the questions with pauses so students can practice reading the questions aloud. Make sure that they understand all the questions. Tell them to work in pairs and put them into the breakout rooms. Student A and Student B should take turns at asking and answering. Encourage them to use the follow-up question And you? . Check on their performance as they practice. Take notes of any mistakes they make to correct afterward following the appropriate correction technique.

Talk to your Friend | This exercise is for students to work on listening and pronunciation skills such as tongue positioning, stress, intonation, connected speech, and rhythm. First, ask students to observe the picture on the virtual board and try to guess what the dialogue is about and what words may be related to the image. Then read the dialogue with their books closed and elicit from them the vocabulary they could understand. Ask students to open their books. Read the dialogue one more time and have students read each sentence in groups in unison. Finally, they should role-play the dialogue in the private rooms once, switch roles, and do it again. If there is time left, ask them to perform it a third time and substitute words according to their reality. Check on their performance as they practice. If you need to correct pronunciation and/or structure, draw students' attention to the accurate patterns, following the appropriate correction technique.

Listen, Number, and Role-play | The activity aims to work on listening skills as well as sentence structure. First, ask students to observe the images on the virtual board and tell you what they see. Tell them they will listen to a short dialogue. They should listen to it and number the images according to what they hear. Read the dialogue once so they can only listen, and then read it again and ask students to write the numbers. Check their answers. Next, create breakout rooms for them to work in pairs. Based on both the short dialogue they heard and the images, they should write a short dialogue and role-play it. Before they start, draw their attention to the Useful Phrases box on the virtual board and tell them those are some chunks to help their writing. Visit the breakout rooms, checking on their performance, and giving help as needed. If there is time left, the pairs should present their dialogue to the group.

Listen and Number | This activity is for students to work on listening skills as well as pronunciation, accuracy, and sentence structure. First, ask students to observe the images on the virtual board and tell you what they see (vocabulary only). Then tell them that they are going to listen to six situations, and they must number the pictures according to what they hear. Read the content once so students only relate what they hear to the images, read it a second time for numbering, and a third time for checking. Check their answers; don't ask students for the numbers they wrote for each illustration, but to say the situation they heard for each one of them, so they will have more speaking practice.

Drilling Practice | There are two types of drilling exercises for the output lessons: substitution practice and changes. They are supposed to take 12 minutes of the class in total, but they are spread throughout the lesson, so students feel less tired and more confi  dent while performing them. See the steps below:

- Substitution practice I and II: read the sentence in Portuguese and choose a group of students to translate it to English. Then, read the extension also in Portuguese and these same students should respond with the complete sentence, but now using the extension you gave translated. Follow the same steps until you go through all the sentences. Make sure students keep a motivating rhythm while saying the sentences and the pair/trio is engaged in providing the correct answers. Change the groups every two sentences to make it more dynamic. Correct mistakes using the correction techniques mentioned before in this guide.
- Changes: explain how students should respond to the sentences according to the title in each lesson (Change into affi rmative / Change into negative / Change into interrogative). To give them an example, read the fi  rst sentence making the suggested change. Read the sentences in English and have students change them, working in pairs or trios, according to the example you provided. The oral practice should always be performed in unison by those groups. If any correction is needed, draw students' attention to the accurate patterns, following the appropriate correction techniques.

UNLOCK | The prompts in this section aim to help students review and recall the vocabulary and the language structures studied in the previous lessons. Use them to elicit from students' themebased vocabulary as well as grammar points. Follow the same procedure for the Assessment sections in the input lessons, providing the prompt in English, in Portuguese, and fi  nally in English again. Also, encourage all students to cooperate and respond appropriately. Explore all the prompts in this section to review and consolidate the content studied to the given point. In case of mistakes, draw students' attention to the given language structure or pronunciation pattern that needs correction, using the appropriate correction technique for the whole group.

Last Checking | To raise students' sense of progress, ask questions individually, such as:

- Tell me what you learned today.
- Make two sentences using that content that we've seen today.
- What did you most like learning today?
- Tell me three diff  erent words that you saw in today's lesson.
- Did you learn a lot today? What did you learn?
- How are you going to use this content in your daily life?

Homework Instructions | Explain to students how to do their Homework on Wiz.me. Remind them that they may clear up any doubts and ask for more guidance about their Homework at the Virtual Study Hall.

## Pedagogical General Instructions for the Review lessons - W2

Dubbing | At the end of the last output lesson in each batch of lessons, students will be asked to access Wiz.me, open the Review lesson card, access the Video card, and open the Dubbing feature. In this feature, students will watch a short, muted video. The aim is for them to think and write a short script as if they were the character in the video speaking. Once they have their script ready, they should record their voice in the video, they may record and delete as much as they wish. Then, they should write their fi  nal script on the Written part sheet of the Review lesson at the end of their Workbooks. The Dubbing activity is another opportunity to engage students in their studies in a diff  erent and fun way. It should be

•••

done by students individually and outside of class. Students may show their Dubbing videos to their classmates if they wish during class, with their cameras open or before the Review lesson starts. Although this activity is in the Review lesson, it should not be considered part of their Review scores.

Pinpoint | Read the sentences in this section and have students read after you in unison, one group at a time. Example:

Teacher:

Group 1, I work in the morning.

Group 1:

I work in the morning.

These sentences are a reminder of topics students saw in the previous lessons. You don't need to provide examples or give any explanations at this point, but quickly check if students have any questions and provide support if necessary. Remind them to have their cameras open.

Conversation Practice | This activity aims to create an atmosphere where students feel confi  dent and comfortable to talk. For this reason, the exercise must really be a conversational moment. You don't need to go through all the questions, but every student should participate. As in a real conversation, more than one student can answer the same question. Follow these steps:

- With their cameras open, read a question in Portuguese, and have students say it in English in unison.
- Then, randomly choose somebody to answer.
- Next, you may the same question to another student, or have the fi  rst student to ask it to a classmate.
- Encourage students to ask questions to each other. Move on to another question and repeat the procedure until you reach the timing for the exercise.
- Be aware that, even though you do not need to go through all the questions, they were carefully selected for this activity. There is no need to create diff  erent ones unless you have a bigger number of students.
- Students who are waiting should be paying attention and keep their microphone mute.

Self-assessment (in the Teacher's Guide) | This section has been designed to off  er students the opportunity to review, recall, and consolidate the studied content as well as become aware of the skills they have developed. The key objective of this section is to promote a sense of progress in students. Follow the same steps for the Assessment sections in the input lessons, providing the prompt in English, in Portuguese, and then in English again. With their cameras open, students should reply with words, key phrases, or fragments of sentences. Engage them in this brainstorming and motivate them to participate. In case students don't recognize a topic, provide them with one example, so they come up with others. After you fi  nish this section, ask students to go back to the Student's Book and look at the Self-assessment section there.

Self-assessment (in the Student's Book) | Explain that the purpose of this section is to help them review content and become aware of what they have practiced to this point. Tell them that their honest and objective response is important so you can identify any challenging points in their learning path and be able to give them proper assistance. Next to each of the can-do statements, students will fi  nd tags with the corresponding lesson numbers. This way, they may also look for content on their own, if they wish.  Using the virtual board, the teacher can display this section to help them out. Explain the meaning of the fi  rst two phrases: I can . and I'm not sure if I can . Tell them that you are going to read the can-do statements in English, in Portuguese, and then in English again. As you read each of them, give students a few seconds to mark their responses according to their awareness of their skills. When you have fi  nished, check their productions individually in the breakout rooms while they work on the Written part of the Review.

Review Written Part | Students will fi  nd the Written Part sheets of the Review lessons at the end of their Workbook. On the fi  rst page, students were supposed to write a script according to what they recorded in the Dubbing card. This content is to be considered as homework from the previous output lesson and it should not be graded as a Review score. At this moment in class, students should do the multiple-choice exercise on the second page of the Written Part sheet on the platform. Give them 10 minutes to complete it. The grade for the Report Card should be a combination of students' performance during Conversation practice and the Written Part.

There and Around | As a wrap-up for the batch of lessons, students should prepare and present a role-play using the functions they learned in the There and Around section and the content they learned in the previous lessons. At home, before they come to the Review lesson, students were asked to access Wiz.me and watch the T&amp;A video. This video shows the complete conversation from the comic strips performed by actors. There may be content students haven't learned yet, but this backing content is necessary to make the conversation more natural and closer to reality. If students wish, there are subtitles options in the Personal Assistant. The idea is to motivate and inspire them. In class, after the Written part, if time allows, they may watch the video again. Put students in pairs or groups and tell them they have ten minutes to create their dialogue in the breakout rooms. They can write it down on their coursebook or a separate piece of paper. While students are creating, check the breakout rooms giving support as needed, and reminding students of content they may use. Also, project the Realia on the virtual board, to give them ideas and to be used during the performance.

Note: realia are items custom made for students and very similar to real pieces of propaganda, maps, menus, information fl  yers, etc. The Teacher's Guide kit has a set of Realia for each Review lesson and they are available on Biblioteca Virtual . The reverse side of each piece indicates to which Review lesson it belongs. Students may fi  nd vocabulary or phrases they haven't learned up to this point, but you don't need to read the content or give further explanations. They may use an online dictionary or picture dictionary if they wish. Provide them with support if necessary.

Once the time for the preparation is up, have the pairs or groups present their role-play to the class (they have worked it before in the breakout rooms). You have ten minutes for all presentations. Encourage students to memorize their lines and avoid reading during the performance. If students wish, they may record themselves (as in the video they watched) and post the videos on social media using the hashtags: #thereandaround #wizardw2, for example.

Last Checking | To raise students' sense of progress questions individually, ask questions such as:

- Tell me what you learned today.
- Make two sentences using that content that we've seen today.
- What did you most like learning today?
- Tell me three diff  erent words that you saw in today's lesson.
- Did you learn a lot today? What did you learn?
- How are you going to use this content in your daily life?

Review Feedback (Spread Page) | Before you give the Homework instructions, go back to the spread page in the beginning of the respective batch of lessons, project it on the virtual board, and read the last Learning Objective, related to the T&amp;A section. If students confi  rm it is achieved, they should put a checkmark in this LO.

Homework Instructions | Explain to students how to do their Homework on the platform. Remind them that they may clear up any doubts and ask for more guidance about their Homework at the Virtual Study Hall.

## Pedagogical General Instructions for all the books

1. Use the instructions from New W2 as an example and a guide for all Wizard books.
2. At the end of all classes To raise students' sense of progress, ask questions such as:
- Tell me what you learned today.
- Make two sentences using that content that we've seen today.
- What did you most like learning today?
- Tell me three diff  erent words that you saw in today's lesson.
- Did you learn a lot today? What did you learn?
3. Always recommend Virtual Study Hall and remind students that all questions about the Homework will be resolved during virtual study hall moments.
4. Start your input and output lessons with assessment activities; there is no Homework correction in class.
5. During peer activities use the breakout rooms and try to keep up with as many groups as possible to check their practice.

•••

6. For materials for which Digital Homework isn't available yet, we recommend keeping the procedure instructed for wizathome : The student does the Homework, sends it to the teacher, and after it's been properly corrected, the teacher sends it back through the best means for the school (e-mail, WhatsApp, etc.)
7. Audio material reproduction at this point must be done by the teacher, through reading aloud. This feature is being developed by Elos for future updates.
8. The student can choose another group to take the class he/she missed.
9. As we enroll our Connections students, we have 21 days to place them into a group generally up to Lesson 6. This will give him time to take the fi  ve previous lessons without negatively impacting their learning. We keep the regular procedure we have on in regular classes and groups at school.
