## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Before starting the first lesson of the book, students should watch the Zero Class on Wiz.me . Make sure the video is ready for students to access, and once they finish watching it, check if there are any questions about the content. Students should also take the Diagnosis Pre-test . Explain that, before the last Review lesson, they'll take the Diagnosis Post-test and check their progress in the language. It's important to show students that they should access the Wiz.tab on the Tab and enter their login and password information to start their first class. The audio content with the instructions for all the W10 classes is in English. Make sure students are reproducing the Wiz.tab audio content at a voice volume audible to you. Also, check whether they're focused on the screen or the lesson in their book. If students aren't reproducing the audio files or if they're doing so in a low voice, immediately tell them what to do so that you, the teacher, can hear them, as this is essential for you to offer any necessary support, such as provide correction, pronunciation, or answer questions about structure. In addition, this is a fundamental process which helps them internalize the content. Your guiding and motivational role is essential at this stage to ensure that students understand the purpose of the activity and then have full development of all language skills.

## IF AND ONLY IF GAME

After the warm-up with the whole class, students should access the Tab to start the Self-learning . At first, the themes of each class batch will be presented to them. After that, students will have a Conversation Practice . They will answer some questions with content they already know in English. They should listen and answer the questions aloud and discuss some of the answers with the teacher at the end of the class. After this practice, students will play the If and Only If Game using the offline content, but you can also use its online version. Students will be grouped into teams and use their knowledge of the language as well as their creativity to answer some questions about famous people. Provide support to students when needed and check on their performance in the activity, taking notes of mistakes to be corrected later. In case you have only one W10 student, you may play the game with him/her during the Teacher Support. After finishing the Spread Page activity, students should answer some questions about the importance of studying English in the Let's understand the reasons why you study English activity. Explain that you'd like to know why they study English to help them achieve their goals. Distribute the sheet for Let's understand the reasons why you study English , read the questions with the students, give them a few minutes to do

•••

the activity, and collect the answer sheets. At the end of the class, present the Class Preparation card , for the preparation of the first Input Lesson in their batch, and the Video card , so that they can watch the introductory video about There and Around on Wiz. me . Also, clarify any questions students may have about the lesson routine, how to use the Tab , the Wiz.pen , and Wiz.me .

## INPUT LESSONS

Opening page: Each batch of lessons starts with a Spread Page , which contains: a theme, a picture for context, and the list of Learning Objectives to present to students.

The presentation of this section will happen only once, at the beginning of the first class of the batch. Students will return to this page at the end of each Input Lesson to check on their learning.

## SELF-ASSESSMENT

In the second and third Input Lessons of each batch, students go through the Self-Assessment section. They are instructed to give examples and answer some questions in English to review previous class content.

## LESSON OPENING

At the beginning of each Input Lesson , students are instructed to open their books to the first page of the lesson, look at the picture, and explain how it matches the title. After that, they answer a few questions related to the topic of the lesson.

## INPUT CLASS PREPARATION

Starting with Lesson 241, students should answer some questions related to the content they studied during the lesson preparation.

## VERBS

In this section, students must have the content previously prepared for the class.

The Tab presents the verbs, and the students listen, read, and say the new content aloud. Students are free to read, listen, and speak as many times as they want.

## NEW WORDS

In this section, the vocabulary will be presented through cards with words. When clicking on the words, students will have visual support and also listen to the pronunciation. They will be able to click on the word to read and listen to the content as many times as they want.

## IDIOMS

In this section, students are presented with sentences and read the content, paying attention to the items in bold. Students will be guided by the audio in this step; however, they can read, listen to, and say the sentences as many times as they think necessary.

## LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS

Finally, students arrive at the Language Functions section, where they read the sentences in English. They must follow the audio instructions and follow the content on the Tab screen. Students can read, listen to, and say the sentences as many times as they want.

There will always be two tasks (interactive activities) after the presentation of the Language Functions . The tasks for the first two Output Lessons are fixed, and for the third Output Lesson they are variable. In the first Input Lesson of each batch, students will have the Match and Maze tasks; in the second, Lead in Text and Read and Match , and in the third one, Image Phrase and Lead in Task or Put in Order . Further on this guide, you'll see a list containing the step by step instructions that students must follow to accomplish each of these tasks.

## LANGUAGE PRACTICE

Students must reproduce the sentences they hear. For each sentence, they'll find two more words or expressions. Students should use them to modify the original sentence. There are also a few questions about the lesson content. At this point, they must reproduce the questions and then answer them. They are instructed to write down any questions they may have about this section for clarification with you during the Teacher Support .

At the end of this stage of the Input Lesson , the students practice the content of the Verbs , New Words , Idioms , and Language Functions sections without the support of the reading text, that is, they must practice the content again using only their listening and speaking skills. When noticing difficulties or pronunciation errors, correct/help students as soon as possible, using one of the correction techniques of our methodology.

## REAL LIFE

Students are directed to the Real Life section in their books. In this activity, they're given the chance to expand their knowledge of the theme by watching a video, listening to an audio, or reading a text.

These are the steps students should follow in the first Input Lesson of each batch:

4

-  They listen to the questions from the Getting the most out of the theme box, reproduce them, and answer them aloud.
-  Then they go over the questions in Getting the most of the video box, but do not answer them yet.
-  Finally, they watch the video on Wiz.me and answer the questions aloud.
-  To check their answers, students answer the questions on Wiz.me .

For the second Input Lesson , students should follow the steps below:

-  They listen to the questions from the Getting the most of the theme box, reproduce them, and answer them aloud.
-  Then they go over the questions in Getting the most of the audio box but do not answer them.

•  Finally, they listen to the audio on

Wiz.me and

answer the questions aloud.

-  To check their answers, students complete the sentences with the words from the box on Wiz.me .

And these are the steps students should follow in the third Input lesson of each batch:

-  They listen to the questions from the Getting the most of the theme box, reproduce them, and answer them aloud.
-  Then they go over the questions in Getting the most of the text box but do not answer them.
-  Finally, they read the text in their books and answer the questions aloud.
-  To check their answers, students read the sentence halves and match them.

## DISCUSSION

This activity provides students with a moment for a deeper discussion on a topic with you, during the Teacher Support . They start by listening to the audio and reproducing it out loud. Then they answer some questions using the information they've seen in the Real Life session.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Students are instructed to return to the opening page of the batch and mark the Learning Objectives they achieved once they finish the lesson. During Teacher Support , at the end of the class, check the objectives students achieved and the ones they didn't. If necessary, recommend remedial classes or extra practice in the Study Hall .

## HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS

Students should open the Workbook and follow the audio, which will give them the instructions for each

activity to be done at home. They should also listen to the instructions on what to do on Wiz.me .

## TEACHER SUPPORT

The Tab informs students that they've completed the lesson. Use the Checking Sentences to practice the most important phrases of the lesson with them. When necessary, check out the Learning Objectives and contextualize the phrases from Language Functions . Also, be prepared for a discussion on the topic presented in the Discussion activity. During your lesson preparation, check what else students should present to you. Finally, if time allows, students can return to Real Life to watch the video, listen to the audio, or read the text again, or they can engage in some other interaction with the classmates present in the room.

## INPUT LESSON TASKS

In order to make the class more interactive and dynamic, W10 brings a series of tasks that comprise the Input Lessons . These tasks help students to work with the content, reinforce it, and visualize what is being taught. See the list of activities mapped out below:

Match: Students read the sentences on the screen. They should drag each of them to the corresponding picture. Then they listen to the audio.

Maze: Students organize the content on the screen in order to form four sentences. Then they listen to the audio to check their answers.

Lead-in text: Students listen to a text with missing information. Then they choose the words to fill in the blanks.

Read and match: Students read and match the phrases to form complete sentences.

Image-Phrase: Students look at the picture that illustrates the text. Then they drag the words from the box to the corresponding blanks to form sentences related to the pictures.

Put in order: Students listen to the audio and put the words in the order they hear them.

## OUTPUT LESSONS

The Output Lessons are composed of four activities in the book; the first three will vary, but the last one will always be There and Around . In W10, students do the two variable activities in Wiz.tab , with access to answers in real-time. If in doubt, they should resolve any questions with you during the

Teacher Support . The other variable activity will be prepared in Wiz.tab , but it will be done with you during the Teacher Support . This activity is always the first one described in the Checking Sentences document.

It's important to mention that, at the beginning of every Output Lesson , before starting the lesson itself, students will answer some questions to review the content of the previous class. See further information on the list of Output Activities Lessons . Class details, such as what is done in each step, or what to do and expect from the student in the Teacher Support , will be found in the Checking Sentences document.

## FACT OR OPINION?

From two quotes extracted from the authentic material of the previous Input Lesson , students decide whether the passages are based on facts or opinions and justify their answers. In order to check the answers, students listen to the audio on the Wiz.tab .

## LINES OF THINKING

Students are instructed to listen to the audio and link the idea that is presented to a line of thinking, theory, piece of information, or experience they have gone through or heard about. They should take notes for further discussion with you during the Teacher Support .

## RHETORICAL QUESTIONS

This activity aims to help students recognize and use rhetorical questions to create a dramatic effect or make a point, rather than to get an answer. Students are instructed to listen to the model, paying attention to intonation, and reproduce it aloud. Then they read some sentences or questions in their books and answer each of them with a rhetorical question and their own ideas. Students check their understanding by doing a task on Wiz.me . They drag the words from the box to complete a definition of one of the rhetorical questions.

## CASE STUDY

This activity provides students with a great opportunity to develop their decision-making and problem-solving skills. Students are instructed to read the title of each case in their books and predict what it's about. Then they listen to the speakers introducing their cases and asking for help to solve a problem. Students think about possible solutions to the problem and discuss them with you during the Teacher Support .

•••

## WHAT'S ON THE CHART?

This activity helps students interpret, synthesize, and report information found on a chart. Students have a look at the title, subtitle, and graphic(s) in their books. Then they say what they understand about the topic in discussion, besides interpreting and reporting the data they see using the Useful Language content. To check their understanding, students mark True or False for some statements about the data shown in the graphic.

## DID YOU OVERHEAR THAT?

Students' goal in this activity is to recognize the tone, ironic attitudes, and mood in casual conversations, formal presentations, or discussions by inference. Students listen to some questions to predict what they'll hear and say their ideas aloud. Then they're instructed to listen to the audio, paying attention to the meaning and intonation of the conversation to guess how people are feeling. They complete the sentences with the missing words to check their answers on the Wiz.tab .

## CONTROVERSY

In this activity, students are given the opportunity to develop argumentative skills. They start by reading a statement in their books and saying it aloud. The Useful Language content in their books will help them develop arguments to defend a point of view on the topic, even if they personally don't agree with it. You're expected to contradict the students' arguments during the Teacher Support even if, in fact, you agree with them.

## TIME TO INTERVENE

In this activity, students are given the opportunity to intervene in a discussion on a familiar topic. They start the activity by saying what communication problems they're aware of. After listening to the audio content, they answer some questions about it. To check their answers, students fill in the blanks of a few short passages.

## WHAT TONE IS THAT?

Students start the activity by talking about feelings and how they express them when speaking. Then they reproduce some sentences using different intonations to express different feelings. After that, students listen to the audio to try to recognize the characters' feelings and emotions and write their answers in their books. For correction, they do a task on Wiz.tab to match the answers.

## INTERCULTURAL ENCOUNTER

The aim of this activity is to help students understand and discuss different cultural backgrounds based on four listening passages. They're instructed to look at the pictures in their books and say aloud what they represent. They read the statement below the pictures, reproduce it aloud, and say how they think it's related to the pictures. After that, students listen to the audio with four extracts - each one related to a picture. They check if their predictions were accurate and answer the question in their books. To check their answers on Wiz.me , students complete the blanks in one of the extracts they've listened to.

## INTO THE REAL WORLD

In this activity, students listen to low-quality announcements and get information from them. Students start the activity by saying whatever comes to mind when thinking about public announcements. Then they listen to the audio and answer questions about it. For correction, they match the sentences in Wiz.tab to get the answers.

## WHAT'S TRENDING TODAY?

This exercise aims at fostering discussions on contemporary issues and current affairs. To start the activity, students are instructed to look at the picture in their books and talk about what they see. Then they read the statement or question in their books and get prepared for the discussion with you during the Teacher Support .

## THERE AND AROUND

This activity is developed along the three Output Lessons from the batch. In W10, students will work to develop projects based on specific text genres, such as reports, pitch decks, or essays. They'll work on a different text genre in each batch. In the first Output Lesson of the batch, students are guided to watch the first part of an instructional video and take notes. After that, they take a look at the realia and start thinking of ideas for the text they'll develop to present in the Review class . In the second class, students listen to the second part of the instructional video and start preparing and producing the work for their presentation. In the third class, they watch the third part of the video and finish their work.

## LANGUAGE PRACTICE

In this activity, students work on paraphrasing. First, they listen and reproduce the spoken phrases. Right after each sentence, there's vocabulary that should be used as a replacement of one part of the original sentence without changing its meaning. Students must always say the complete sentence. If in doubt, they can take notes to show you at the time of the Teacher Support .

## UNLOCK

In this activity, students listen to prompts or questions about the content of the lesson. They must pause the audio to respond to the prompts or answer the questions.

## HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS

At the end of each Output Lesson , students are instructed to complete homework on Wiz.me , as well as access the Class Preparation card to prepare for the next Input Lesson . Still on Wiz.me , at home, after each Output Lesson , students must watch the There and Around videos. Before each Review Lesson , students are instructed to access the Review card and watch the video related to the Pinpoint section.

## REVIEW LESSONS

## PINPOINT

Students are always guided to prepare for a  lesson by accessing the Review card at home after the last Output Lesson of each batch. If, for any reason, they haven't been able to do so, they should take advantage of this moment. They start the activity by reading a short text, the content of the Getting the most out of the language box, and by reflecting on the question in their books. Next, they listen to a testimonial on the same topic. Students should then read parts of the testimonial on the Wiz.tab and choose the correct answers to check their understanding. They finally answer some questions and reflect on how they can help the speaker solve a problem or dilemma. Students share their ideas with you during the Teacher Support .

## LANGUAGE PRACTICE

Students listen to questions related to the content of the batch and answer them, justifying their answers aloud.

## SELF-ASSESSMENT (Student's Book)

On the Wiz.tab , students are instructed to complete the Self-assessment in their book. Include, in your preparation, the checking of the Self-assessment answers during the class. Ask if they have any questions and what they think they need to do to improve their performance. If necessary, recommend remedial classes or extra practice in the Study Hall .

## WRITTEN PART

Next, the audio from Wiz.tab directs the students to the Workbook . They should watch the full There and Around video again. They should also answer the multiple-choice questions on the Written Part page of the respective Review Lesson . Ask them not to consult their material while answering the questions, nor clarify doubts with their colleagues and with you. Once finished, they should hand the sheet to you. Then they return to the Tab to continue the class.

## THERE AND AROUND

As the last step of the lesson, Wiz.tab indicates to the students that to conclude the batch, they should review the final version of the work they prepared in previous Output Lessons and make the necessary final adjustments for the presentation that will take place during the Teacher Support .

## HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS

At the end of the Review Lesson , Wiz.tab indicates to students what they should do for homework in their Workbook . It will also remind them to access the Class Preparation card as a preparation for the next lesson.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Wiz.tab will direct students to return to the opening pages of the batch and finish checking whether all the Learning Objectives have been marked. It's important that you remind students where the Learning Objectives of the batch are listed.
