Being with , I grew up thinking I was a genetic , a freak of nature. The type of dwarfi  sm I have is called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital , and it has all my joints. I have had arthritis ever since I can remember. By the I was ten, I couldn't tie my shoes or put socks on. My childhood, it was challenging. I remember one boy in particular who just liked to me. This one time, I was walking home from school late, and he got down on his knees and started walking around me, saying, 'Look, I'm a dwarf, too.'

And I remember there was spit bubbling out the sides of his mouth. He was eye to eye and laughing in my face. In my 20s, when I started to read books and personal growth philosophy, that's when I started to realize, 'I'm on my way. I can have as good a life I believe in.' I worked hard to change my system from victimhood to , and it transformed my life. So now I want to help other people do the same thing.

## WHY AMERICANS ARE LONELIER AND ITS EFFECTS ON OUR HEALTH

John Yang highlights the signifi  cance of robust social connections in promoting longevity, health, and happiness. However, according to Census Bureau surveys, people were spending less time with friends and more time alone, a pattern that predates the pandemic. This shift has exacerbated feelings of social isolation and loneliness.

Laurie Santos, a cognitive scientist and psychology professor at Yale University, teaches Psychology and the Good Life , one of the institution's most popular courses. Santos has extended her teachings to a podcast called The Happiness Lab . When asked about how pervasive the problem of loneliness in the United States was, Santos described it as a signifi  cant issue, often likened to an epidemic. She notes that approximately 60 percent of people in the U.S. report feeling lonely on a regular basis. This statistic is alarming from a public health perspective, surpassing rates of obesity and diabetes.

Santos emphasizes the detrimental impact of loneliness on both physical and mental health, underscoring its status as a signifi  cant public health concern.

At the moment, SAF accounts for less one percent of global jet fuel and costs three to five times more than its fossil-based sibling. And not all SAFs are created equal.

The one SAF is not the same the other. You have the pure biofuels. So you grow something somewhere and then make out of that. And then you have the waste-based fuels. And the last one is a completely different way to do it. You suck the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, add hydrogen to it, green hydrogen. So, there are many limitations here. And based on that, there is a process. You can make fuel, kerosene - e-fuel, they call it. And that's actually the best one because you close the carbon cycle completely.

e-fuels are still years away from being commercially . Biofuels, though, are readily available. But production of them needs to be up dramatically. If the airline industry is to hit its emissions targets, SAF production needs to ramp up to around 450 billion liters per year by 2050. To put that figure into context, Finnish firm Neste TM  produced 125 million liters of SAF last year, and that is the largest SAF in the world. Neste TM  is also investing 1.9 billion euros to expand and adapt its Rotterdam biodiesel , pushing its global SAF production to around 2.75 billion liters annually.

Could technology taking center stage in the U.S. save animals from extinction? A Dallas biotech start-up wants to resurrect the woolly mammoth, the Tasmanian tiger, and even the dodo. Colossal Biosciences TM , founded in 2021, describes itself as a de-extinction company aiming to reverse human-inflicted biodiversity loss and bring additional species to the planet.

But scientists and conservationists warn that the effects of de-extinction could be unpredictable. There are questions over the ethics of releasing resurrected species into altered habitats and ecosystems, as well as bringing genetically altered embryos to term.

The return species will be lookalikes rather than genetic copies of their originals. To remake the dodo, which went extinct due to hunting in the 17 th  century, Colossal TM  will alter the genome of the Nicobar pigeon. For the replica mammoth, which will be tuskless to deter poachers, they'll tap into the genetic code of the Asian elephant.

But concern is also growing that de-extinction projects like this could divert funds from conservation programs. With 42,000 living species threatened with extinction right now, the race to save them is on.

According to Philip Rosedale, the is not a realm where a company with an advertising-based should hold sway. He emphasizes that Second Life TM , the virtual he created, has never been reliant on advertising. Rosedale attributes this, in part, to the timing of the company's inception, which predates the rise of advertising as a viable business model. Having the company in '99, before the exponential growth of the ad business, particularly with Google TM , Rosedale notes that advertising was not initially viewed as a feasible option. While the idea of implementing was discussed, Rosedale and his team were reluctant to interfere with users' , given that Second Life TM  is collectively owned by its . While there are advertisements for products like clothing within the virtual world, the primary focus of Second Life TM  does not involve altering user or capturing their attention. Rosedale expresses concern about the potential dangers of transitioning advertising practices from the 2D online world to the immersive 3D metaverse environment.

Today, digital technologies are transforming the supply chain, benefiting everyone - from small farmers in Africa to buyers of diamond rings. For smallholders in developing countries, the inability to hold a record of transactions often makes it impossible to get good access to credit, exposing them to predatory lenders. But blockchain technology might improve this situation. In Zambia, software company BenQ TM  has joined drinks company AB InBev TM  to give cassava and barley farmers a record which is accessible by mobile phone of all the sales to their company. This enables them to build a history, which in turn lets them secure loans and win contracts.

Meanwhile, IBM's Food Trust TM  initiative uses the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and blockchain to capture and share information along the supply chain. This can reduce food waste and quickly identify the source of any contamination. This means recalls are much easier to manage. And to tackle problems such as deforestation, the sustainability consultancy South Pole TM  taps into a range of tools, including big data and satellite mapping. The company can assess climate risk and how the activities of companies, governments, and others are affecting the world's forests. The goal is then to reduce the carbon footprint of their supply chains. One digital technology at a time, the supply chain is becoming ever more efficient and transparent.

A hyperloop is a high-speed, long-distance transportation system in which vehicles (pods) with no wheels move through low-pressure tubes with minimal friction or aerodynamic drag, potentially reaching speeds of over 1200 km/h while using less energy than either air or rail travel. Instead of wheels, pods use magnetic levitation and electromagnetic propulsion to glide through the tube. The whole system is electrically powered.

The tube is sealed, and air is pumped out to create a vacuum inside the tube. This minimizes air resistance as the pod moves through the tube. Electromagnets levitate the pod, making it float or hover above (or below) a guideway. This minimizes friction since the pod does not touch any surface inside the tube. Then a pair of linear induction motors, one along the pod and one along the guideway, interact with each other electromagnetically to propel the vehicle through the tube.

Adapted from: Technical English 2nd edition. Level 4, page 46.

- a. Hyperloop pods use wheels for propulsion.
- b. The hyperloop system is primarily powered by gasoline.
- c. Electromagnets are used to touch the surfaces inside the tube to reduce friction for pods.
- d. Linear induction motors are used to propel hyperloop pods through the tube.

The difficult kind of ethical situation is one where you feel angry and helpless as a result of someone else's or manipulation. You didn't ask to be pushed around, but you are. One minute, you're minding your own , and the next minute, you're being to lie or are bullied by someone else. In any conflict that involves the act of one person toward another, the helpless one asks the question, 'How can someone treat another person like that?' You just shake your head and shudder at what's going on in the mind of that person. It's the same question a child asks about the playground . 'How can a person be so mean to someone else? Doesn't he or she have any feelings?' On the other side, maybe you found yourself in the position of someone else to do something unethical. What were you thinking?

Let's go inside the mind of the unscrupulous . You can psychoanalyze his inner rage, insecurities, past negative experiences, or plain ignorance, and come up all sorts of theories as to what's behind this behavior. But put those issues aside for a moment and imagine how he perceives the other people in his life. How does he view people around him? How can he people so badly and sleep well at night? These questions lead us to the fundamental principle of human value. The value you place on certain individuals will show in your behavior toward them.

I think recovering from betrayal may require time, introspection, and sometimes forgiveness, but it also serves as a vivid reminder of the importance of trust and the fragility of human bonds. It's my recommendation to take your time to heal from betrayal. Reflect, forgive when you're ready, and remember the importance of trust in relationships.

Would you allow me to say something? I strongly believe that the action of retaliating against someone occurs when individuals encounter harm or perceived transgressions and respond with similar actions, often driven by assumptions or a desire for revenge. So, believe me, it can perpetuate a cycle of harm.

We should consider different scenarios. For example, the confidence they have in others' honesty and reliability are the cornerstone of strong relationships, whether personal or professional.

I understand your point, and I think methodical people often encounter a range of assessments, both favorable and unfavorable. They are frequently seen as trustworthy and meticulous in work-related situations, yet they may also be viewed as inflexible or excessively careful, which can impede advancements and interpersonal connections.

Bluntly put, true happiness is intrinsically tied to a sense of accomplishment. Achieving success is the proof that naturally satisfies our efforts and aspirations. It's a deep-rooted human desire for validation and progress. By nature, we are goal-oriented beings. From early hunters tracking down prey to modern individuals climbing prestigious corporate ladders, there's a drive to succeed. The joy in achieving a goal, no matter how big or small, is unparalleled because success often justifies the time and energy spent, and the sacrifices made. Without these timely markers of success, individuals may be forced to cope with feelings of stagnation, worthlessness, or a lack of purpose, feeling unfulfilled. Success is celebrated and sought after in most cultures, making it intrinsically linked with happiness. But while happiness is subjective, the human psyche develops on acknowledgment, growth, and achievement, making success a fundamental component of genuine joy.

If you're considering traveling to a diff  erent destination, you might want to take a tip from novelist and poet Russell Banks. In the age of social media, selfi  es, and even selfi  e sticks, he talks about the diff  erences between a traveler and a tourist.

According to Russel, one way to distinguish a tourist from a traveler is that a tourist carries a camera or a phone and takes pictures with one or both. A traveler carries no camera and uses his or her phone mainly to make occasional phone calls home or when lost for the GPS. 'I used to carry a camera when I traveled, but almost never took any pictures with it and apologized when I returned home until I realized that my reluctance to point and click was really a reluctance to line up and edit and frame whatever I was seeing or hearing or smelling: the fall of the morning sunlight against the glittering sea, the crinkled face of an old woman selling spices in the market. It was, I believe, an instinctive reluctance to remove myself from my experience, an experience that could only occur far from home and habit, where the rules as much as the landscape were unfamiliar.' He adds, 'To photograph was somehow to

reduce and domesticate my experience and, ultimately, kill it. I knew this, but still felt somehow apologetic for not having brought back a photographic record of the death of my experience.'

Ninety-two-year-old Joy Ryan and her grandson Brad Ryan have spent the past seven years crisscrossing the U.S. with the goal of visiting every national park. Grandma Joy's Road Trip, as they call it on social media, began after Brad found out his grandmother had never seen a mountain before. And that started them on a trip of a lifetime. They both have been steadily chipping away, visiting every one of the 63 national parks.

When asked about what prompted this idea, Brad mentioned an innate desire to make sure that the sunset of his grandmother's life was fi  lled with as many memories as they could pack in. He adds, 'Because she had a willing spirit, and she showed that she still had a lot of adventure left to live.' When they went on that fi  rst trip by climbing mountains, camping, and enjoying all of the things that blew him away, he didn't see any reason to stop.

Brad Ryan adds that they didn't know what they were getting into until they were thrown into it. They arrived at the Elkmont campground in the Smokies at around 1:00 or 2:00 a.m., and rain was pouring down. They ate a lot of ramen noodles on a budget when they made their 28-day camping trip around the Lower 48 for the fi  rst time. But as they say, it was nothing but joyful.

My trip to Osaka was truly a of a lifetime, and whoever has been there is likely to agree with me. As I through the vibrant streets of Dotonbori, I watched the city's culture and history before my eyes. Going off   the beaten path led me to hidden temples and calm gardens, the serenity was a stark contrast to the bustling city.

And then there was the unexpected , making the city even more beautiful. It felt like a dream. The cuisine was a of fl  avors, from Takoyaki street to Michelin TM -starred sushi.

I believe that all you need to enjoy a trip to the fullest is to to know the culture of a place and the citizens who live there.

There are two types of we can : one that embraces problems as opportunities to learn and one that avoids them, often out of the fear of failure. People who avoid conflicts can be described as having a mindset. Those who see problems as interesting challenges have a growth mindset. Sometimes, we like to make a from one to the other.

People have a fixed mindset because they believe that basic qualities like intelligence or talents are fixed traits, and that these traits are responsible for success. They often like to document past . With a growth mindset, people believe that new abilities can be developed practice. This view creates the love for learning that most great leaders and artists have in common. For them, life becomes an exciting journey with endless opportunities to figure new things and advance.

To develop a growth mindset, Dr. Carol Dweck, the Stanford University professor coined the term, advises leaders, teachers, and parents to celebrate trying. Teachers should students for any grade if they studied hard. Parents should encourage the children to develop any new skill they are interested . Doing this will make them learn the skill of learning, which will also help them back in the classroom.

Have you ever wondered how our modern got started? Where did ideas for our government, our ways of thinking, even our sporting events come from? Many of our ideas were infl  uenced by the civilization of ancient Greece. What's really amazing is that this incredible civilization existed about 2,500 years ago.

The ancient Greeks created a way of life that was admired and copied people around the globe. At its peak, the ancient Greek civilization covered quite a bit of territory. It got its start in Greece and the Greek islands. The ancient Greeks also lived along the west coast of what is now the country of Turkey. They also settled in colonies along the Mediterranean Sea coast. The land in this area is largely made up of mountains and sea. The areas that were most useful for farming were found in the valleys or islands.

Cities were established in these valleys and along the coastal . These cities only infl  uenced the area immediately around them because they were cut off   from others by mountains and sea.

Each unique area was known as a or polis. A polis usually included the city and the fi  elds and villages that surrounded it. Polis often shows up as a prefi  x or suffi x in some of our English words, like 'metropolis' or 'Indianapolis.'

The residents of the city-states were all Greek, so they shared some customs. However, each city-state was diff  erent and held its own . Some city-states fought one another, while others forces to fi  ght a larger enemy, the Persian .

In 1918, a devastating pandemic known as the Spanish fl  u swept across the world. It was over fi  ve times deadlier than World War I, claiming an estimated 100 million lives compared to the 18 million lives lost in the war. After the pandemic ended, it triggered major changes in medical care in nations all across Europe. European governments realized that public health is far too complex to treat as just an individual challenge, leading them to convert to universal healthcare systems. They began off  ering healthcare at no out-of-pocket cost to individuals, with expenses covered by taxes or other mechanisms.

In 1666, London faced a devastating fi  re that destroyed 80% of the city, alongside a plague outbreak. Despite the death and destruction, England's scientifi  c community played a crucial role, with fi  gures like Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Isaac Newton contributing to rebuilding eff  orts through scientifi  c innovation and discovery.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States found itself in the midst of a severe economic crisis. President Herbert Hoover's reluctance to interfere with the economy and a protectionist trade strategy had little eff  ect in stopping the crisis's growing impact, leading to high unemployment rates and economic instability. In contrast, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt implemented various programs collectively known as the New Deal to address the economic challenges, including initiatives to stimulate the economy, provide social security, and reform banking and international trade. They expanded the government's size, scope, and infl  uence over the economy, aiming to alleviate the burden of the Great Depression and prevent similar crises in the future.

Sophia is the of David Hanson and his team at Hanson Robotics TM . She may look incredibly and sound just like you or me, but she's actually a robot. She's carried on conversations with some of the world's top offi cials, and she's even been awarded citizenship by Saudi Arabia.

What makes Sophia so is the way she nails some of the fi  ner details of what it means to be human, like personality and facial expressions. And in doing so, she forces us to how we think of robots and their role in our lives. David Hanson believes the key to making them truly boils to character. He says that consumers are starting to adopt robotics in a very exciting way-the industry has been for some time now. So now, voice-based are considerably more prevalent, and we have a lot of smart speaker technology that can bring AI into the home, which is increasingly providing useful services to people in their homes.

Voice is a kind of natural interaction, but interact with facial expressions, gestures, and eye contact; this is a very powerful mode communication. Very high bandwidth communication, if you will, meaning that we can get more thoughts through, we can connect. So, we can take AI and robotics and transform them into a more complete natural interface, then these products can be more meaningful in our lives.

Can digital technology and smart science help solve the world's food waste crisis? The United Nations has estimated that a third of all food produced is wasted or lost. But some entrepreneurs and scientists think emerging technology could help stop the rot. U.S. food waste start-ups raised $4.8 billion in 2021, 30 percent more than they raised in 2020.

Some of the innovations are designed to help farmers. Apps like Plantix TM  can identify pests or diseases early. Image recognition technology is used to diagnose any problems in the fi  eld. The app then links growers to plant experts so that crops can be saved before they're ruined. Globally, around 20 percent of food is wasted at the farm. But businesses like San Francisco-based Full Harvest TM  aim to fi  nd new buyers for rejected and surplus produce.

But innovation alone is no magical solution. Cost can be a barrier to implementation. For example, Kroger TM , the largest supermarket chain in the U.S., said shoppers were not willing to pay more for fruit with an edible plant-based coating designed to keep it fresh, and ended its deal with Apeel Sciences TM , the product's maker, last year. Another limitation is that close to 30 percent of food waste occurs in the home. But perhaps the greatest challenge facing innovators is that in many societies, we have normalized throwing away food we don't want to eat. And until that changes, the impact technology can have will always be limited.

Some time ago, the Business Roundtable TM , which speaks for America's biggest companies, from Amazon TM  to JP Morgan Chase TM , provided a hint. The group its two-decade-old declaration that corporations exist principally to serve their to enshrine a fundamental commitment to all of our : customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and last in the list, investors.

,

Enthusiasts for companies with a positive purpose that goes beyond profi  t are clear. Companies that do not start paying more attention to their own staff  , the communities they serve, and the environment as a simply will not survive to be the companies of the future. Businesses that do a broader purpose, on the hand, will benefi  t from the reinforced enthusiasm and commitment of their employees and customers.

Critics point out,

, that purpose is hard to defi  ne, let alone to measure.

And there are other obstacles in the way of a permanent shift to a , purpose-led form of capitalism. Many asset managers and some asset owners still seek short-term returns and are rewarded accordingly. National and regional diff  erences in corporate culture make it hard to apply a one-size-fi  ts-all approach without antagonizing pure profi  t seekers in, say, the U.S., or long-termism in Europe. Then there's the threat of growing cynicism if companies disappoint by falling of their promises.

Few would dispute that we should all recycle more and waste less. But when it comes to drink packaging, are national deposit return schemes, or DRS, the best way to cut litter and create a more circular economy? It's a question that's dividing opinion as Scotland moved to add an extra 20 pence to the cost of each bottle or can of drink in August 2023, which will be refunded on return to a shop or vending machine.

Similar schemes have been operating in Europe, North America, Israel, and parts of the Caribbean and Australia. Canada was the fi  rst to launch legally binding deposit returns in 1970. But it's Germany that tops the table in terms of DRS recovery. Ninety-eight percent of all drink cans, plastic, and glass bottles sold in Germany are returned. Norway ranks second in DRS recovery at around 92 percent.

![Image](/workspaces/Datamaster/diversos/PDFs/arquivos_portal/saidas/Pedagogico-ExtraActivities-ExtraActivitiesW12_OutputExercises/Pedagogico-ExtraActivities-ExtraActivitiesW12_OutputExercises_artifacts/image_000051_443c2c23619d06b516fc0c51303b5d3e72db13f6a38ee8c91bdddb2fe4a35adb.png)

Before Germany's deposit system was introduced in 2003, around 3 billion disposable drink containers were dumped across the country each year. Now, such waste is negligible as consumers seek to recoup up to 25 euro cents typically added to the price of every can and bottle. So what's not to like, especially in countries like the U.K., where more than 8 billion drink containers were wasted in 2019?

The designer of Scotland's DRS plan says the scheme should be funded by drinks producers, unredeemed deposits, and the sale of recyclable materials. But critics claim store owners and shoppers will face extra costs and inconvenience to process returns and that local councils will lose income as metals, glass, and other recyclables currently gathered from household rubbish collections are redirected to the DRS scheme.

Motivation is the experience of wanting something or wanting to avoid it. When we study how we get motivated to learn, develop, and succeed, we can identify two forces: extrinsic and ones.

On the one hand, we want to belong, desire to be loved, and seek to get the attention we think we deserve. We are motivated extrinsically by rewards in order to progress

On the other hand, we exploring things that are in themselves when we disregard rewards. We are motivated intrinsically by a natural curiosity, which we follow because it feels right. The opinions of others don't matter.

Listening to our hearts can tell us we are but not how to be happy among others. Listening to others can motivate us to be a part of their world but doesn't teach us if that world is ours. This is it's probably good for the two to go together. Then we can learn what we want and get the feedback we need in order to stay motivated to explore new roads to a better society.

A large body of research shows that balancing the two forces is not . One meta-analysis of 128 studies examined the eff  ects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation.

most rewards signifi  cantly undermine our intrinsic interest, positive feedback, which is an extrinsic motivator, inspires us to keep going. Quite , honest words of encouragement get us going, while money or gifts undermine our inner drive. What about you? Do you listen to your heart or the voices of society? And from your personal experience, which of the two eventually takes your decision?

I'd say that it would be perfectly fi  ne if I boosted my career and amassed wealth in my early thirties. However, it's also important to prioritize personal fulfi  llment and well-being alongside professional success. Anyways, tell me about your views on personal and professional fulfi  llment. What's your take on this?

This is a topic that is close to my heart because I always tell people that I'm not prone to extravagance; I would never spend my money on unnecessary things. I was raised to practice frugality. However, I do believe in investing in experiences that enrich my life.

It's funny you should ask that because, to be honest, I strongly believe that working at thrift is the only way to quit living below my means. What's more , adopting a frugal lifestyle can help build fi  nancial security and provide a sense of peace of mind.

It is strongly believed that people who tend to amass money also tend to forget about the impact on their well-being. Yet, if we look at it from another angle, we can certainly see the importance of remembering that true wealth includes mental and emotional health.

## Read the text and mark True (T) or False (F). Justify the false statements.

It is estimated that the average social media user has 150 friends, but the average person is believed to have seven social media accounts. Friendships these days are not restricted to real-life interactions, nor are they restricted to one social media platform. Evidence suggests that quantity doesn't necessarily mean quality. In Dunbar's initial research, friendships were broken down into types. The average person had around 50 good friendships, 15 close friendships, and an intimate support group that usually consisted of just fi  ve people.

![Image](/workspaces/Datamaster/diversos/PDFs/arquivos_portal/saidas/Pedagogico-ExtraActivities-ExtraActivitiesW12_OutputExercises/Pedagogico-ExtraActivities-ExtraActivitiesW12_OutputExercises_artifacts/image_000058_23f58d69c02e75b081ec7cfacb5c0511ee6909b85c22ce9f9fdbf33a64da3771.png)

Current research has shown that although our average number of total friendships has increased, the number of close and intimate friendships we maintain has stayed roughly the same. Online friendships may be commonplace, but research suggests they are no substitute for the real thing. Why don't the online friendships we build become more intimate? It's possible they don't satisfy us-not in the same way that real friendships do. Researchers found that our number of real-life friends directly correlates with our well-being-the more friends you have in real life, the happier you are. However, they found no evidence that the size of our online friendships has the same eff  ect. Even if our virtual friendship network grows far beyond Dunbar's number, it's still our real-life friendships that mean the most to us.

The underlying issue making these virtual relationships seem less fulfi  lling could be emotional distance. Researchers found that people are happier and laugh 50% more frequently during face-to-face interactions than in online interactions.

Further research has shown that physical touch, like hugging, is also crucial for building social bonds. Video calls can bridge the gap to an extent, but it isn't possible to fully replicate physical bonding in a virtual world. Overall, research suggests that online relationships fail to reproduce the emotional and physical intimacy of real-life friendships, and they don't trigger the same feelings of well-being as real-world relationships do.

Adapted from: Modern Friendships: is more really better? / StartUp Level 8, p. 24-25.

- a. Today, people don't have exclusively online friends, neither do they interact with people only on one social media platform.

- b. Online friendships are thought to be a suitable substitute for real-life friendships.

- c. Video calls can usually fully replicate physical bonding in a virtual world.

- d. Research shows that online connections do not evoke the equivalent sense of well-being as interpersonal relationships in the physical world.
