## AUDIO SCRIPTS GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

## I NTRODUCTION

Hello, teacher!

It is an immense pleasure to present you with the Interactive Teacher's Guide. This material was designed to help you teach the best Interactive class, being aware of what concerns your students' steps and also yours. You will get to know the complete Interactive Experience , which includes: the five steps of the class, the detailed Teacher Support procedure, the lessons' structure, the Interactive Tasks explanations, the lessons' steps on the Wiz.tab, the Wiz.me card descriptions, and the Lessons' Instructions.

By reading this guide, your class preparation will be much more effective because you will be conscious of what Wiz.tab introduces to your students, and how you can master their knowledge by checking their performance.

So, let's start this journey.

## WHAT IS THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE?

This experience was planned to bring language learning to students who prefer a more autonomous study routine and need to study within a specific schedule. The Interactive teacher is a dynamic and attentive professional, able to deal with students from different levels at the same time. The Wiz.tab is the technology tool that must be used by each student in the classroom.

The class has five moments and some of them can happen simultaneously, no matter if it is a Wizard In or a Wizard On group. The moments are:

- WARM-UP | An oral activity, at the beginning of the class, which promotes interaction among the students no matter their level.
- SELF-LEARNING | This is the moment, exactly after the Warm-up, in which the students, using the Wiz.tab, will interact with the lessons' content speaking in an audible voice. It is important to mention that the teacher should listen and follow the students while they practice by themselves. Walk around the classroom or enter the breakout rooms, if it is a Wizard On class, to accompany students.
- TEACHER SUPPORT | Each student will have the Teacher Support according to the class agenda. In this moment, the teacher will have the opportunity to check the student's learning. See more information about this step on the next section of this guide.
- PEER WORK | This is the moment of interaction between students. The teacher should prepare beforehand what pair or trio of students will work together and what Output activity from the Student's Book will be done, according to the students' necessity. Remember that the interaction respects the lower book level.
- CLOSING | The purpose of this last moment is to give students the awareness of learning through oral activities, such as the ones done for the Warm-up, or through a speech prepared by a student to be presented to the group. It is especially important to promote integration and interaction among students.

For further information, it is recommended to read the MOP, Manual de Operações Pedagógicas .

## TEACHER SUPPORT

For the third edition of Teens 2, we have designed a new experience for the moment of Teacher Support. Instead of having students perform only the Drilling Practice sentences, we believe teachers should make better use of this time, engaging students in freer conversations, checking exercises, and clearing up doubts.

For this reason, the Teacher Support in this guide will present:

- the descriptions of the steps the students have on Wiz.tab;
- some Audio scripts of the Interactive Tasks;
- the necessary Answer keys for the Interactive Tasks;
- the drilling activities that have to be done with the students;
- you will find some extra practice in the Should You Have Extra Time section for the students that perform exceedingly well.. This is an exclusive section for the Interactive experience, and it must be done only if necessary, as a complement to finish the Teacher Support. All this is found in a highlighted box at the end of each lesson, in this guide.

## TEENS 2 3 RD  EDITION'S STRUCTURE

There are four types of lessons in this edition of Teens 2: Useful Language, Input Lessons, Output Lessons, and Review Lessons. The Useful Language Lesson gives the students the opportunity to get to know each other and the teacher. The students will receive information

about the course and the coursebook, the characters of the Teens series, and some greetings and classroom language. The Input Lessons focus on the new content presentation and practice through the four languages skills. The Output Lessons engage students in mastering the content through a variety of activities. The Review Lessons bring to students and teachers the moment of closing the learning trail and also the awareness of content retention quality.

## I NTERACTIVE TASKS

For the Interactive Experience, students are presented with more than the activities they see in their Student's Books. On their Wiz.tabs, among the lessons' sections, students will find the Interactive Tasks . They were designed to complement and reinforce the self-learning of the students, as well as promoting a more entertaining and pleasurable class. They are activities focused on the content of the lesson studied and provide students with a variety of ways to put it into practice. Here's a list of the Interactive Tasks in Teens 2:

- LISTEN AND MATCH | The students read, listen to four words or sentences, and match to the corresponding image.
- PUT IN ORDER | The students listen to four sentences and put the words in order.
- MATCH | The students see four sentences and match each one to the corresponding image. Then they listen to the audio and reproduce it out loud.
- TEXT DIALOGUE DRAG AND DROP | The students read the text and complete the blanks using the words from the boxes.
- MATCH THE SENTENCES | In the right column, there are answers or complements to the sentences in the left column. The students read and match them. At the end, they listen to the audio and reproduce it out loud.
- LEAD IN TEXT | The students listen to an incomplete audio and click on the words to complete the text. Images appear as hints to help them choose the right word.
- MAZE | The students see four sentences out of order, then they put the words or parts of sentences in the correct order. After doing so, they click the Check button to confirm their answers. At the end, they listen to the audio and reproduce the complete sentences out loud.
- LISTEN AND CHOOSE | The students see four images, listen to the audio, and click on the corresponding images.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

- IMAGE PHRASE TYPE | The students read a dialogue and match the words to complete it. After doing so, they click on the Check button to confirm their answers.
- TEXT PAGE SCRAMBLED | The students listen to a text and drag the words to complete it.
- LISTEN AND DRAG TO PUT IN ORDER | The students click on the audio button, listen to a dialogue or a story, and put the sentences in order.
- CHOOSE THE CORRECT ANSWER - FOLLOW-UP | The students listen to some questions about the text they have heard and choose the answer on the screen.
- LISTEN AND NUMBER - FOLLOW-UP | The students listen to three letters that correspond to an image of the Listen and Number activity in the Student's Book, write a sentence for this image in their notebook, and show these sentences to the teacher during the Teacher Support.
- PINPOINT - FOLLOW-UP | The students listen to some sentences from the Pinpoint , rewrite them substituting the words in bold for other words learned in the previous lessons, and show to the teacher during Teacher Support.

## AUDIO SCRIPTS GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

## THE LESSONS' STEPS ON THE WIZ.TAB

This guide will describe to you all the steps, sections, and exercises the students do while doing the Self-learning moment. By reading the following explanations you will get to know what the Interactive students will listen to and understand exactly how they learn. Therefore, you will be able to provide more focused Teacher Support.

For Teens 2, the Wiz.tab audio instructions were recorded in Portuguese, so students are more confident while performing the activities. Students may use the Voice Management system to change the narrator's voice and also change the narration speed, making it slower or faster. It is important that the student has his / her Student's Book, Workbook, notebook and the Wiz.me at hand, since the audio refers to these during the lessons. Bear in mind that students can and will pause the Wiz.tab during the activities to do written tasks or to prepare themselves for the Teacher Support.

## USEFUL LANGUAGE LESSON

ZERO CLASS | The audio asks the student if he / she has watched the Zero Class on Wiz.me. If the student has not, he / she is instructed to talk to the teacher.

ABOUT ME | The audio asks the student to write his / her name in the center of a sheet of paper and to draw two things he / she likes, and one that he / she dislikes. During Teacher Support, you have to guess what your student likes and dislikes.

FIND SOMEONE WHO | On the same sheet of paper, the student has to write, in Portuguese, some experiences he / she has already had.
